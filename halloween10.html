<h1 class='centered'>Halloween X: Follow The Money</h1>
<h2 class='centered'>3 Mar 2004 (with a Sep 30 2006 update)</h2>

<p>Excuse me, did we say in Halloween IX that Microsoft's
under-the-table payoff to SCO for attacking Linux was just <a
href='halloween9.html'>eleven million dollars</a>?  Turns out we were
off by nearly an order of magnitude &mdash; it was much, much more than
that.</p>

<p>The document below was emailed to me by an anonymous whistleblower
inside SCO.  He tells me the typos and syntax bobbles were in the
original.  I could not, when I received it, certify its authenticity,
but I presumed that IBM's, Red Hat's, Novell's, AutoZone's, and 
Daimler-Chryler's lawyers could subpoena the original. On March 4th, 
within 24 hours of publication, SCO confirmed that the memo is legitimate.</p>

<p>Explanatory comments are interspersed in <span
class='commentcolor'>this color</span> (I changed this from green
because of complaints from the colorblind).  Particularly noteworthy
bits of the original are in <span class='highlight'>this color</span>.</p>

Chris:

I know you were going totalk to Bob later Friday, but I figured I would
outline the issues.
</pre>

<p class='comment'><a
href='http://thescogroup.com/company/execs/rbench.html'>Bob Bench</a>
is is the Chief Financial Officer of the SCO group.  He is in the Cc
line.</p>

<p class='comment'>Mike Anderer is a consultant with
an outfit called <a href='http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102542/000104746904002142/a2127332zex-10_15.htm'>S2</a> that bills itself as a <q>Strategic Consulting</q> firm, in their M&A group. His name is <a href='http://eol.finsys.com/edgar_conv_html/2004/01/28/0001047469-04-002142.html#A2127332ZEX-10_15_HTM_TOC_FA1112_1'>in SCO's SEC filings</a>.  </p>

<p class='comment'>S2 held <a href='http://contracts.onecle.com/sco/s2.warrant.2003.07.01.shtml'>warrants</a> on SCO stock in July 2003.  They were thus in a 
position to profit if they had reason to anticipate a spike in this othwerwise
unpromising stock (SCO/Caldera had never been profitable).</p>

<p class='comment'>Tim Rushing has put together a 
<a href='http://www.threenorth.com/sco/timeline.html'>timeline</a> of 
events involving Anderer and the SCO/Microsoft connection.</p>

<pre>1) <span class='highlight'>Baystar is easy as they were just a Microsoft referral</span> and would be 2%
</pre>

<p class='comment'>Baystar Capital is a venture-capital firm.
In 2003 SCO got about fifty million dollars from them in a <a
href='http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20031016164004379'>deal</a>
that was rumored to have Microsoft's hand behind it.  This confirms
the rumor.</p>

<p class='comment'>That is particularly interesting in view of the 
<a href='http://biz.yahoo.com/e/031209/scox8-k.html'>agreement</a> that 
gives holders of 33.4% of the Baystar Series A stock the right to 
approve or or veto actions leading to contingency payments
to Boies and the other two law firms. One suspects that digging into the identities of Series A shareholders &mdash; and their ties to Microsoft &mdash; might yield interesting results.</p>

<pre>2) Any licensing deal would be at 5%

3) Much of the other work would go from 2% to 3% as I have engaged in
direct, but this would require according to Bob either Darl or you
signing off on the fact that this ane was not a referral.
</pre>

<p class='comment'>Mike Anderer is discussing his fee for brokering the deal.</p>

<pre>4)  On the patent side for IPX, where foes that fit it.  I am working
with the lawyers to get these moved from provisional to more complete in
the next week.  I think it will spawn at least 3 patents.  Ed and I are
the inventors on these.  What do we fo here
</pre>

<p class='comment'>My original commentary observed that IPX is
a network stack developed by Novell.  The implication was that Mike
Anderer thinks SCO might be able to get a patent lock on it, so they
were looking for IP leverage against Novell.  This is probably wrong;
he was more likely referring to <a href='http://www.ipxonline.com'>this 
IPX</a>, a company that exists to help set up patent litigation.</p>

<p class='comment'>Provisional patent applications "die" in one year from
filing date, so whatever applications he's talking about were filed no 
earlier than Oct 2002
and converted to real applications no earlier than Oct 2003 (because
they aren't done as of the date on the memo).  Average pendency for
software patents is 2-3 years. The patents thus will most likely not be
issued until 2006 (if ever). The applications are generally published 18
months after filing, though. (They must be published unless they intend
to file them only in the USA.) So, one might expect to see the
applications published in Apr/May 2005.</p>

<p class='comment'>If the patents in question ever go live, they should be findable with <a href='http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=0&f=S&l=50&d=ptxt&Query=IN%2F%22Anderer%3B+Mike%22+AND+IS%2FUT'>this search</a> once they go live.  Right now this search reveals three patents with Anderer's name, and that "Ed" is probably Ed Iacobucci.</p>

<pre>5) The RedHat, Acrylis examiniation, there is no upside here is this
billable seperatly.  I bought a PC and loaded up RedHat and will take
that over and work through it with the Lawfirm.  What do we do here?
</pre>

<p class='comment'>Acrylis is a company that Caldera (which became
SCO) <a href='http://zdnet.com.com/2100-11_2-527834.html'>partnered
with in 2001</a>; they were later acquired by Caldera.  On page 53 of
<a href='http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102542/000091205702001965/a2068129z10-k.txt'>SCO's 2002 10-K</a> it says:</p>

<blockquote class='comment'>
On May 3, 2001, the Company acquired the WhatIfLinux technology from
Acrylis, Inc. WhatIfLinux technology provides Open Source users and
system administrators with Internet-delivered tools and services for
faster, more reliable software management. In consideration for the
assets acquired from Acrylis, the Company issued 1.25 million shares
of common stock with a market price of $1.95 per share, or
approximately $2.4 million, paid $1.0 million in cash and incurred
approximately $0.1 million in direct expenses. The Company has
accounted for the acquisition of the WhatIfLinux technology using the
purchase method of accounting. The allocation of the consideration
paid for the WhatIfLinux technology consisted of assigning
approximately $3.0 million to purchased technology and $0.5 million to
goodwill. The acquired technology is being amortized over a three-year
life.
</blockquote>

<p class='comment'>In context, the word "examination" seems likely to refer to examination of a patent claim.  One of the inventors on <a href='http://assignments.uspto.gov/assignments/q?db=pat&pat=6529784'>this patent</a>, a man formerly employed at Acrylis and SCO, thinks it might be the one in question. It'a core patent of WhatIf, and certainly reads like it could be used to attack Red Hat Network.</p>

<p class='comment'>The ongoing lawsuit between Red Hat and SCO is
documented <a href='http://sco.tuxrocks.com/?Case=RH'>here</a>.</p>

<pre>I realize the last negotiations are not as much fun, but <span class='highlight'>Microsoft will
have brough in $86 million for us including Baystar.</span>  The next deal <span class='highlight'>we
should be able to get from $16-20</span>, but it will be brutial as it is for
go to makerket work and some licences.  I know we can do this , if
everyone stays on board and still wants to do a deal.  I just want to
get this deal and move away from corp dev and out into the marketing
andfield dollars....In this market we can get $3-5 million in
incremental deals and not have to go through the gauntlet which will get
tougher next week with the SR VP's.
</pre>

<p class='comment'>This is the smoking gun.  We now know that
Microsoft raised $86 million for SCO,  but according to the
SCO conference call this morning (03 Mar 2004) their cash reserves
were $68.5 million.  If not for Microsoft, SCO would be at least $15
million in debt today.</p>

<p class='comment'>The "$16 to $20" is probably $16 to $20 million in
cash, and since this memo is five months old that deal is almost
certainly completed by now. This means it's possible SCO has burned
through as much as $30 million in just a year of barratry.</p>

<p class='comment'>But there is a more interesting (if farfetched) 
possibility. Just a couple of days after October 12 SCO's stock price 
rose sharply from $16 to $20.  I don't think the context of the memo
supports this reading...but was Microsoft so confident of its ability 
to manipulate SCO's stock price that it offered to do that as a payoff?</p>

<p class='comment'>Some people think I'm double-counting that second deal,
or that it never went through at all.  I'll admit the language is ambiguous,
but the low-ball interpretation of the numbers is $66M (Anderer's $86M minus
his high $20M figure for the value of the second deal).  That's still a hell of lot of money, essentially the entirety of SCO's cash position in its 1Q2004 
10Q.  So the only difference here is that SCO would merely be flat broke 
without Microsoft, rather than $15M in the hole.</p>

<p class='comment'>The part that starts <q>I just want</q> is
interesting, too.  It looks as though Anderer is talking about
shopping for a wealthier patron group within Microsoft's corporate
hierarchy; SCO has been taking money from Microsoft <q>corp dev</q>
(probably <q>corporate development</q>) but the gauntlet of
Microsoft's senior vice-presidents is about to make that more
difficult.  He thinks they can get more money from <q>marketing and
field dollars</q>. Later paragraphs suggest that he's talking about 
talking co-marketing money out of different groups within Microsoft, 
probably their Corporate Marketing and Field Marketing groups.</p>

<pre>
We should line up some small acquisitions here to jump start this if we
do it.  We shoudl also do this ASAP.  Microsoft also indicated there was
a lot more money out there and <span class='highlight'>they would clearly rather use Baystar
"like" entities to help us get signifigantly more money</span> if we want to
grow further or do acquisitions
</pre>

<p class='comment'>In other words, Microsoft wanted to funnel its
anti-Linux payoff through third parties.  Maybe in case the antitrust
guys at the Department of Justice happen not to be asleep at the
switch?</p>

<p class='comment'>The bit about acquisitions seems more ominous when
you remember that Caldera/SCO has a long history of lawsuits over
obsolete technologies stripped out of dead companies &mdash; starting
with DR-DOS from Digital Research and continuing through USL's System
V into the present with the IBM lawsuit.</p>

<pre><span class='highlight'>This Microsoft deal is the Ante to the poker game...We should get this
done and go after several $2-3 Million deals from the expense side of
their company.</span>
</pre>

<p class='comment'>So their revenue plan for the future is to hit Microsoft up for money, then hit them up for more money.</p>

<pre>The will help us a lot and if we execute we could exit and Unix
componients we have build potentially back to Microsoft or MCS.</pre>

<p class='comment'>MCS probably equals Microsoft Consulting Services here.</p>

<pre>I think they are on track and may not be able to push much more this
round, <span class='highlight'>but there are other ways to get money from them</span>, their partners,
investment bank referrals, etc..

Do kepp in mind that they have brough us between $82 million and $86
million if this deal is between $4million per quarter where Rich is at,
or it turns into %5 million wjich is the lowest number Chris had
interest in.
</pre>

<p class='comment'><q>Rich</q>, in context, must be whoever at
Microsoft Corporate Development was responsible for haggling with
Chris (Sontag) over the magnitude of SCO's payoffs.  He is probably <a
href='http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2000/Nov00/EmersonPR.asp'>Rich
Emerson</a>, Microsoft's Senior Vice President of Corporate
Development and Strategy. The third-person reference to <q>Chris</q>
might seem odd considering that the memo is addressed to him, but
people sometimes do that in email when it has more than one
recipient.</p>

<p class='comment'>The "Ante to the poker game" is the $16-$20 million deal 
that was current at the time the memo was written.  Somewhere between $66 
and $86 million had already been delivered.  Together, they're 
counting on between $66,000,000 and $106,000,000 from Microsoft's 
corporate development division alone...</p>

<p class='comment'>This paragraph, closely read, strongly suggests that 
"$16 to $20" is  in fact a cash spread, not a stock price spread, and is
denominated in millions.  $4M times 4 quarters is $16M, $5M times 4 quarters
is $20M.</p>

<pre><span class='highlight'>There will be more, lons, partnerships, etc</span>..but we need to just get
this one done.  It is too high profile, it is also critical, but they
are not the people to pitch.  <span class='highlight'>We should get what we can from them ad
then work the other and larger areas of the company</span> and groups where
they have real budget and need for our help.
</pre>

<p class='comment'>...and that $66 to $106 million is before they hit up the
<em>rest</em> of Microsoft.</p>

<pre>Let me know your thoughts.

-Mike
</pre>
<hr/>

<p>There you have it.  At least a third of SCO's entire market 
capitalization, and their entire current cash reserves, is payoffs 
funnelled from Microsoft.  Their 10Qs reveal that
every other line of cash inflow is statistical noise by comparison.
The brave new SCOsource business model is now clear: sue your 
customers, shill for Microsoft, kite your stock, and pray you stay
out of jail.</p>

<p>Five days after this memo was written, SCO's PR chief Blake Stowell
responded to widespread speculation that Microsoft was behind the
Bystar deal by <a
href='http://www.eweek.com/print_article/0,3048,a=109986,00.asp'>vehemently
denying</a> it.</p>

<p>This continues to be SCO's party line.  Their 
<a href='http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1542915,00.asp'>response</a> 
acknowledges that the memo is authentic but claims that Anderer &mdash;
the consultant they  hired to find, handle, and brief the Board Of Directors 
about this kind of <q>Transaction</q> (see the 
<em>Statement of Work</em> in his
<a href='http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102542/000104746904002142/a2127332zex-10_15.htm'>contract with SCO</a>), was mistaken about the deal.  They
would have us believe that Anderer wrote this memo to Chris Sontag expecting
to collect a commission for bringing in Microsoft on a deal that, according 
to SCO, didn't involve Microsoft at all.</p>

<p>We think the kindest interpretation we can put on these events is that 
Blake Stowell isn't lying through his teeth, but was kept out of the loop 
so he could honestly deny all knowledge of Microsoft's involvement.  If so, 
we wonder what else SCO's director of PR doesn't know...</p>

<p>September 2006 update: <a
href='http://www.groklaw.net/pdf/IBM-828.pdf'>IBM's MEMORANDUM in
Support re [783] MOTION for Summary Judgment on SCO's Interference
Claims</a> contains a couple of quotes from BayStar's Mr. Goldfarb
(page 20):</p>

<blockquote>
"Mr. Emerson [Microsoft's senior vice president of corporate
development and strategy] and I discussed a variety of investment
structures wherein Microsoft would 'backstop,' or guarantee in some
way, BayStar's investment....Microsoft assured me that it would in
some way guarantee BayStar's investment in SCO."
</blockquote>

<p>However, after BayStar made its investment,</p>

<blockquote>
"Microsoft stopped returning my phone calls and emails, and to the
best of my knowledge, Mr. Emerson was fired from Microsoft"
</blockquote>

<p>So Microsoft used BayStar to do its dirty work, then stiffed 'em.</p>

<p>And, of course, the next question to ask, the one that might pierce all
of SCO's and Microsoft's denials, is a very simple one: did Mike Anderer 
get paid his commission on this "misunderstood" transaction?</p>

<p>There is reason to believe that <a href='http://trends.newsforge.com/trends/04/03/08/0457259.shtml'>the Securities and Exchange Commission is on this 
case.</a></p>

<p>On 13 March 2004, Mike Anderer gave an 
<a href="http://www.newsforge.com/trends/04/03/12/1731252.shtml">interview</a>
on NewsForge in which he says "I suspect Microsoft may have 50 or more of 
these lawsuits in the queue."</a>

<p>November 2007 update: On July 18
2007 <a
href="http://assignments.uspto.gov/assignments/q?db=pat&pat=6529784">passed
</a> the WhatIf patent, gratis, to a shell company called <a
href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20071108123523631">Cattleback
Holdings</a>, less than 60 days before declaring bankruptcy.  This
certainly looks like an attempt to keep that patent out of the hands
of the creditors' committee so SCO can do more damage with it later.</p>
