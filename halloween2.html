<h1>Halloween Document II (Version 1.7)</h1>
<hr/>
	
<h2>Linux OS Competitive Analysis:<br/>
The Next Java VM?</h2>
	
<div class="comment">{

<p>This memorandum was clearly written as the followup to the one on open
source which I have previously annotated as the `Halloween Document' (now <a
href="halloween1.html">Halloween I</a>; you
should browse it first). Halloween II was leaked to me by a former
Microsoft employee 3 Nov 1998, three days after I published
Halloween I, apparently as a direct result of the national
press coverage that received.</p>

<p>It tells us much less about Microsoft's intentions and strategy than
Halloween I.  On the other hand, it is more directly useful to 
operating-system customers trying to evaluate Microsoft's credibility
vis-a-vis that of Linux vendors.</p>

<p>In this context, the author's extremely positive evaluation of Linux's
market share, performance, reliability, and viability in the server
role is very interesting &mdash; and completely the opposite of Microsoft's
dismissive public statements to date.</p>

<p>Actually, readers would do well to bear in mind that many of the positive 
statements in here are short of the truth; they reflect not so much reality
as the limits of what a Microsoft employee can admit to, even internally.</p>

<h2>Key Quotes:</h2>

<p>Here are some notable quotes from the document, with hotlinks to where
they are embedded.  It's helpful to know that <q>OSS</q> is the author's
abbreviation for <q>Open Source Software</q>.</p>

<blockquote><font color="red">
<a href="#quote1">*</a>
Linux represents a best-of-breed UNIX, that is trusted in mission
critical applications, and - due to it's open source code - has a long
term credibility which exceeds many other competitive OS's.
</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font color="red">
<a href="#quote2">*</a>
Most of the primary apps that people require when they move to Linux are
already available for free. This includes web servers, POP clients,
mail servers, text editors, etc
</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font color="red">
<a href="#quote3">*</a>
An advanced Win32 GUI user would have a short learning cycle to become
productive [under Linux].
</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font color="red">
<a href="#quote4">*</a>
I previously had IE4/NT4 on the same box and by comparison the
combination of Linux / Navigator ran at least 30-40% faster when
rendering simple HTML + graphics.
</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font color="red">
<a href="#quote5">*</a>
Long term, my simple experiments do indicate that Linux has a chance
at the desktop market ...
</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font color="red">
<a href="#quote6">*</a>
Consumers Love It.
</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font color="red">
<a href="#quote6">*</a>
Linux's (real and perceived) virtues over Windows NT include:
Customization ... Availability/Reliability
... Scaleability/Performance ... Interoperability ...
</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font color="red">
<a href="#quote7">*</a>
Linux is emerging as a key operating system in the nascent thin server market
</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font color="red">
<a href="#quote8">*</a>
Using today's server requirements, Linux is a credible alternative to
commercial developed servers in many, high volume applications.
</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font color="red">
<a href="#quote9">*</a>
The effect of patents and copyright in combatting Linux remains to be
investigated.
</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font color="red">
<a href="#quote10">*</a>
Note, however, that Compaq and Dell merely have to credibly threaten
Linux adoption in order to push for lower OEM OS pricing.
</font></blockquote>

In compiling these quotes, I have ignored material that essentially
duplicates that found in the <a href="halloween1.html">Halloween
I</a>.

<h2>How To Read This Document:</h2>

<p>Comments in this color, surrounded by curly brackets, are me (<a
href="http://www.catb.org/~esr">Eric S. Raymond</a>).  I have
highlighted what I believe to be key points in the original text by
turning them <span class="highlight">red</span>.  I have inserted comments
near these key points; you can skim the document by surfing
through this comment index in sequence.</p>

<h2>Threat Assessment:</h2>

<p>This memorandum reiterates the sinister suggestion that Linux can be
stopped if standard protocols are <q>de-commoditized</q> &mdash; that is,
perverted with incompatible extensions, then used to lock in
customers.  This threat is extensively discussed in my annotations
for <a href="halloween1.html">Halloween I</a></p>

<p>This memorandum also suggests that Linux could be attacked through patent 
lawsuits.</p>

I've paraphrased some of the key points below.</p>
<p align="justify">Linux was original the brainchild of Linus Torvalds, an undergraduate student at the University of Helsinki. In addition to a 80386-based kernel, Linus wrote keyboard and screen drivers to attach to PC hardware and provided this code under GNU's Public License on an FTP site in the summer of 1991.</p>
<p align="justify">After hosting his work on the FTP site, he announced it's availability on a Minix USENET discussion group in late summer 1991.   By January of 1992, over 100 users / hackers had downloaded Linux and - more importantly - were regularly contributing / updating the source code with new fixes, device drivers, etc.</p>
<p align="justify">In contrast to the FSF/GNU work, which provided developers an open source abstraction above the underlying, commercial UNIX OS kernel, Linux's team was creating a completely open source kernel.  In time, more and more of the GNU user/shell work was ported to Linux to round out the platform for hackers.</p>

</font><font face="Helvetica" size="3"><p align="justify">After the release of version 1.0.  The Linux developer community adopted a management structure to control what is added to the kernel with even numbered releases as  stable, production release branches and odd numbered versions were &quot;developer&quot; branches.</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">While major areas of the kernel have &quot;owners&quot; which maintain their areas, Linus remains the final say on what does and does not go into the kernel.  In large part, this structure remains in place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is important to distinguish that this management structure only controls the actual kernel and does not include supporting areas like the GUI, system utilities and servers, and system libraries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since 1.0, the following 1.x branches existed:</p>
<p>1.1 3/95</p>
<p>1.2 8/95</p>
<p>1.3 6/96</p>

That's true. On the other hand, most people have been using 2.1.x for many
months with no crashes, and fewer reboots over that time than the
average winows or NT installation has to do in an average week.<p>

Linus could have shipped 2.2 in Spring '98 and had a stable,
high-quality kernel.  It's just that he's got higher standards than Microsoft.

</font><font face="Helvetica" size="3"><p> &quot;Linux&quot; is technically just a kernel, not the entire supporting OS.  In order to create a usable product, Linux &quot;distributions&quot; are created which bundle the kernel, drivers, apps and many other components necessary for the full UNIX/GUI experience.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These subsystems are typically developed in an OSS manner as well and several of them  - e.g. the Xfree86 GUI - have a codebase size/complexity that exceeds the Linux kernel. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These external components come from many sources and are individually hand picked by the distribution vendor for a particular product.  A frequent source of controversy stems from distribution vendors bundling non-GPL code with the Linux kernel and mass distributing them.</p>

</font><div class="comment">{
A Microsoft developer who wishes to remain anonymous comments:<p>

MS really shoots themselves in the foot in driver space.  For those of us
that will willingly spend effort to improve the quality, functionality,
and availability of device drivers for MS OSs, the tools, etc. they
provide are actually getting progressively worse.  This is happening
largely because MS fails to grasp the basic concepts you've been
talking about.  In response to driver quality and availability
issues, they've consistently made exactly the wrong decisions: rather
than encouraging more people to help and providing better tools, they
try to make the system more and more closed and dumb down the tools.<p>

A significant side effect of this is the killing of innovation - MS,
being a monolithic organization, can really only concentrate on a
few initiatives at a time, and improving device (printers, video, input,
disk, ...) functinality and performance is rarely very high on the
list.  This is a great example of where they should let someone else
(either a partner or an industry standards body - or maybe even an open-source
community!) `homestead' a driver space.  Instead they intentionally make it
more difficult for these 3rd parties to contribute.  The reasonably
plausible reason MS gives for this is to improve system stability - they
blame a lot of NT robustness issues on <q>bad 3rd party drivers</q>.  Instead
of helping the 3rd parties build better drivers (better tools, better
tech support/documentation, actually soliciting input from the 3rd
parties, etc.), though, the MS approach is to assert more control of
the driver space by making more of the system closed.<p>

The ironic effect of this, though, is that the 3rd parties still have
the business need to innovate despite the MS restrictions, so they end
up frequently hacking around the closed parts of the MS solutions with
no documentation - and the overall system stability goes down, not up.
By making the system more closed, they are decreasing stability &
quality, slowing innovation, and losing the opportunity to take
advantage of 3rd parties willing to contribute for free.  The desire
by MS to own and control the interfaces is so strong, though, that
they can't step back far enough to understand what they are doing.<p>

<p align="justify">Interestingly, the Xfree86 development team licenses their code under the BSD license because they consider GPL too restrictive: http://www.redhat.com/linux-info/xfree86/developer.html.</p>
<p align="justify">Configuring the XFree86 system on Linux can be a very difficult, time consuming process. Linux has no hardware abstraction layer for video services, and most video card manufacturers do not provide Linux OS video drivers. Thus, XFree86 provides internal support for a wide variety of video cards and chipsets. Correctly configuring XFree86 requires the user to know the manufacturer, model, and chipset for their video card. In many cases, the user must know or calculate the video timings as well.</p>

<p align="justify">A second round of installation scripts was necessary to install the GUI.   The installer gave me the option of choosing which video subsystem to install / configure and I chose the Xfree86 server because it's an entirely open source system (the other option - MetroX - was provided by Caldera and is believed to be the more stable codebase).</p>
<p align="justify">This part of setup definitely required knowledge of video systems even beyond many power users.   Not only did I have to know the name / make / model of my video card and chipsets but I was presented with questions about their revision numbers, the scan rates of my monitors, etc.  After significant trial and error, I finally got my video system working correctly.</p>

<dir>
<dir>

</font><font face="Helvetica" size="3"><p align="justify">A very illustrative case of how the Linux user community works was revealed by my experiences with the networking subsystem.</p>
<p align="justify">Caldera's OpenLinux installer only provided the client daemon to handle the BootP protocol (as opposed to DHCP) and for some reasons, it didn't install correctly.  I looked around on the CD that Caldera provided for a DHCP daemon and couldn't find one.</p>
<p align="justify">A small number of web sites and FAQs later, I found an FTP site with a Linux DHCP client.  The DHCP client was developed by an engineer employed by Fore Systems (as evidenced by his email address;  I believe, however, that it was developed in his own free time).   A second set of documentation/manuals was written for the DHCP client by a hacker in <I>Hungary</I> which provided relatively simple instructions on how to install/load the client.</p>
<p align="justify">I downloaded &amp; uncompressed the client and typed two simple commands:</p>
<b><p align="justify">Make </b>- compiles the client binaries</p>
<b><p align="justify">Make Install -</b>installed the binaries as a Linux Daemon</p>
<p align="justify">Typing &quot;DHCPCD&quot;  (for DHCP Client Daemon) on the command line triggered the DHCP discovery process and voila, I had IP networking running.</p>
</font><font face="Helvetica Black" size="3"><p>DHCP as an example of Linux process</p>
</font><font face="Helvetica" size="3"><p align="justify">Since I had just downloaded the DHCP client code, on am impulse I played around a bit.   Although the client wasn't as extensible as the DHCP client we are shipping in NT5 (for example, it won't query for arbitrary options &amp; store results), it was obvious how I could write the additional code to implement this functionality.  The full client consisted of about 2600 lines of code.</p>
<p align="justify">One example of esoteric, extended functionality that was clearly patched in by a third party was a set of routines to that would pad the DHCP request with host-speciifc strings required by Cable Modem / ADSL sites.</p>
<p align="justify">A few other steps were required to configure the DHCP client to auto-start and auto-configure my Ethernet interface on boot but these were documented in the client code and in the DHCP documentation from the Hungarian developer.</p>
<p align="justify">Key takeaways here:</p></dir>
</dir>
</dir>


<ul>

<ul>
<p align="justify"><li>Contrary to popular belief, even though this was open source, I never had to touch the `C' code to get the core functionality working.</li></p>
<p align="justify"><li>The author of the driver and the author of the documentation were two geographically separated individuals.</li></p>
<li>The GPL + incremental improvements process had <I>already</I> been at work as evidenced by the Cable Modem/ADSL extensions.</li>
<b><li>Most importantly:  </b>a process that NatBro pointed out in the
OSS paper - &quot;a modestly skilled UNIX programmer can grow into
doing great things with Linux&quot;.  <span class="highlight">I'm a poorly
skilled UNIX programmer but it was immediately obvious to me how to
incrementally extend the DHCP client code (the <I>feeling</I> was
exhilarating and addictive).</span><p>

<p>Additionally, due directly to GPL + having the full development environment in front of me, I was in a position where I could write up my changes and email them out within a couple of hours (in contrast to how things like this would get done in NT).  Engaging in that process would have prepared me for a larger, more ambitious Linux project in the future. </p></dir>

I wonder how familiar they really are, given that the author got the
vendor's name wrong &mdash; it's not <q>Star Corp.</q> but from <q>Star Division

<p align="justify">StarOffice was almost entirely an Office 97 clone from a UI perspective.   The menus, buttons, placement, etc. were all generally identical.    In many cases, large areas of functionality in the menu bar were missing (e.g. Macros).  Other stereotypical Office97 features (e.g. red squiggles under misspelled words) were correctly replicated.</p>
<p align="justify">As a test, I tried importing a somewhat simple PowerPoint document into StarOffice from a floppy disk.  This required jumping into an x-terminal and mounting a new floppy disk into the Linux file system namespace and pointing out to Linux that it was FAT16 formatted.  From there, I launched StarOffice's PowerPoint clone and pointed it at the namespace for the floppy and uploaded the file.</p>
<p align="justify">Simple slides (such as pure text + bullet points)
imported nearly 100% correctly (although fonts and sizing were
changed).   Complex sides (using PowerPoint's line art, etc.) were
almost always totally trashed.</p>
<div class="comment">{

The author of course wrote too soon to see all the excitement since
August.  There are likely to be no fewer than four viable,
full-featured office suites in the near future (ApplixWare, Star
Office, Corel/WP, and Lotus SmartSuite).  A couple of these are
being given away free on Linux for personal use.<p>

And now every major database except Microsoft's is either already
shipping or about to be.  Database servers running on Beowulf should
also be quite a shocker to Microsoft when it happens (maybe to big
UNIX iron too).

<ul>

<ul>
<b><p align="justify"><li><span class="highlight">Customization</span> </b>- The endless customizability of Linux for specific tasks - ranging from GFLOP clustered workstations to 500K RAM installations to dedicated, in-the-closet 486-based DNS servers - makes Linux a very natural choice for &quot;isolated, single-task&quot; servers such as DNS, File, Mail, Web, etc.  Strict application and <I>OS</I> componentization coupled with readily exposed internals make Linux ideal.  </li></p></ul>
</ul>
<dir>

<p align="justify">The threat here is even more pronounced as over time, the number of servers (and consequently dedication to specific tasks) will increase.  Customers enjoy the simpler debugging and fault isolation of individual servers vs a monolithic server runing multiple services. </p></dir>

<ul>

<ul>
<b><p align="justify"><li><span class="highlight">Availability/Reliability</span> </b>- There are hundreds of stories on the web of Linux installations that have been in continuous production for over a year.  Stability more than almost any other feature is the #1 goal of the Linux development community (and the #1 cited weakness of  Windows)</li></p>
<b><p align="justify"><li><span class="highlight">Scaleability/Performance </span></b>- Linux is considered faster than NT in networking, and processes.  In particular, as a server, Linux's modular architecture allows the administrator to turn off graphics, and other non-related subsystems for extreme performance in a particular service</li></p>
<b><p align="justify"><li><span class="highlight">Interoperability</span></b>- Every open protocol on the planet (and many of the closed ones) have been ported to Linux.   In a Windows environment, work from the SAMBA team enables Linux to look like an NT Domain Controller / File Server.</li></p></ul>

</dir>
</dir>


<ul><dir>
<dir>


<ul>
<b><p align="justify"><li>Unix heritage</b> - the server market, especially at the high-end, is already familiar &amp; comfortable with UNIX, Internet-based freeware, etc.</li></p>
<b><p align="justify"><li>Professional users</b> - high end server administrators are often developers/power users themselves and are therefore comfortable with recompiling apps, etc.</li></p>
<b><p align="justify"><li>&quot;Generic&quot; services </b>- these are services defined via open, lowest-common-denominator protocols such as DNS, SMTP, etc.  Functional differentiation is lower in the server market than it is in the client market.   There is a lower bar for experimentation with servers since it disrupts downstream client activity very little.</li></p>
<b><p align="justify"><li>Dedicated Functionality </b>- because servers are typically tasked with a single function (e.g. mail, file/print, database, etc.), the level of required integration with other services and devices in the organization is much lower.</li></p></ul>

</dir>
</dir>


<ul>

<ul>
<a name="drivers">
<b><p align="justify"><li>Cost</b> - ISP's live on horribly tiny margins.  Linux's free price + wide hardware support is consequently very attractive.</li></p>
</a>
<b><p align="justify"><li>Maintainability </b>- If something breaks, it needs to be fixed immediately.  In larger ISPs, the technical expertise to debug code breaks or at least install quickly available patches is plentiful.  Remote manageability in particular is a key attribute.</li></p>
<b><p align="justify"><li>Reliability </b>- perception that non-Linux OS's aren't reliable or scalable enough (in particular Windows NT)</li></p>
<b><p align="justify"><li>UNIX background </b>- ISPs are traditionally Unix havens.   ISP sys admins are very well versed in arcane UNIX command line admin, remote administration, etc.   In a group that's very predisposed towards UNIX's strengths, Linux represents a best-of-breed UNIX.</li></p></ul>

<ul>

<ul>
<b><p align="justify"><li>Source code availability</b> - Freely available source code provides for easy customization of the OS</li></p>
<b><p align="justify"><li>Commodity protocols </b>- Thin servers speak very simple, non-extensible, commodity protocols to clients such as HTTP, SMTP, and SMB.</li></p>
<b><p align="justify"><li>Modularity &amp; Small size </b>- Because the OS was designed in a very non-integrated, componentized manner from the outset, it's very easy to build boxes that don't have a monitor, keyboard, etc.</li></p>
<b><p align="justify"><li>Cost </b>- Obviously, margins are very low in embedded devices &amp; a free OS helps</li></p>
<b><p align="justify"><li>Code Maintenance </b>- Because the Linux source is constantly being upgraded, embedded developers are reassured that new changes / fixes can be snapped back to their systems at any time.</li></p>

<b><p align="justify"><li>Secondary Services </b>- IBM is very strong in consulting, integration, support, etc.  This is their fastest growing business today</li></p>
<b><p align="justify"><li>Loss Leader </b>- IBM's client/low-end operating system business is in shambles (remember OS/2?).  Additionally, IBM has stumbled on various NC/JavaOS systems as well.   By leveraging Linux's credibility (as well as applying IBM's development resources toward improving ease of use?), IBM would hope to upset the status quo in the volume OS space and hope to capture revenue in the ensuing disruption.</li></p>
<b><p align="justify"><li>Commoditizing Downstream Suppliers </b>- As a PC/Hardware OEM, IBM's margins increase by commoditizing a key cost item &mdash; the OS.  In particular, the commoditized &amp; highly customizable qualities of the Linux OS actually provide greater differentiation for hardware vendors.</li></p>
<b><p align="justify"><li>Standards Preemption </b>- The standard to pre-empt is anything Microsoft - in particular new OS services that we integrate directly into future versions of NT.</li></p></ol>

<b><p align="justify"><li>Secondary Services </b>- Sun is not very strong in consulting / integration revenue.  They do, however, make significant revneue in support and maintenance.</li></p>
<b><p align="justify"><li>Loss Leader  </b>&mdash; Sun could market Linux as a low-end OS and try to make money in the UNIX applications space above it.   Because Linux could potentially be a far larger market than anything Sun is accustomed to, this would be a net positive for them.</li></p>
<b><p align="justify"><li>Commoditizing Downstream Suppliers </b>- Sun is also a hardware vendor (with some excellent systems).   Sun would lose their current OS revenue but the ability to sell their hardware into a broader channel could be compelling.</li></p>
<p align="justify">Linux adoption, however, puts Sun at significant risk if their SPARC operations cannot keep up with Intel's innovation pace.</p>
<b><p align="justify"><li>Standards Preemption </b>- Beat Microsoft Standards</li></p></ol>

Some initial thoughts on how to compete with Linux in particular are contained below.   One &quot;blue sky&quot; avenue that should be investigated is if there is any way to turn Linux into an opportunity for Microsoft.</p>

</font><b><font face="Helvetica Black" size="3"><p>Beat UNIX</p>
</b></font><font face="Helvetica" size="3"><p align="justify">The single biggest contributor to Linux's success is the general viability of the UNIX market.   Systematically attacking UNIX in general helps attack Linux in particular. Some Linux-targeted initiatives in this space (not a comprehensive list) include:</p></dir>

<ul>
<b><p align="justify"><li>Improve Low-End &quot;IAM&quot;</b> &mdash; Scaleability, Interoperability, Availability, and Management (SIAM) are the most often cited reasons for using UNIX over NT in mission critical, <U>high-end</U> applications.</li></p></ul>
</dir>
</dir>
</ul>
<dir>
<dir>

<p align="justify">In today's Linux deployments however, scaleability is <U>not</U> the driver as much as Interop, Reliabiliity, and Headless Management.  </p></dir>

</b></font><font face="Helvetica Black" size="3"><p>Modularize / Embed Windows NT</p>
</font><font face="Helvetica" size="3"><p align="justify">Relative to other UNIX's Linux is considered more <I>customizable</I>.   Addressing this functionality involves more than just the embedded Windows NT project.   Greater componentatization &amp; general dependency reduction within NT will improve not only it's stability but also the ability of highly skilled users/admins to deploy task-specific NT installations.</p>
<p align="justify">This requires:</p></dir>

</font><b><font face="Helvetica Black" size="3"><p>Beat commodity protocols / services</p>
</b></font><font face="Helvetica" size="3"><p align="justify">Linux's homebase is currently commodity network and server infrastructure.   By folding extended functionality into today's commodity services and create new protocols, we raise the bar &amp; change the rules of the game.</p>
<p align="justify">Some of the specifics mentioned in the OSS paper:</p></dir>

<ul>

<ul>
<b><p align="justify"><li>DNS integration with Directory</b>.    Leveraging the Directory Service to add value to DNS via dynamic updates, security, authentication</li></p></ul>
</ul>


<ul>

<ul>
<b><p align="justify"><li>HTTP-DAV</b>.   DAV is complex and the protocol spec provides an infinite level of implementation complexity for various applications (e.g. the design for Exchange over DAV is good but certainly not <U>the</U> single obvious design).   Apache will be hard pressed to pick and choose the correct first areas of DAV to implement.</li></p>
<b><p align="justify"><li>Structured storage</b>.   Changes the rules of the game in the file serving space (a key Linux/Apache application).   Create a compelling client-side advantage which can be extended to the server as well (e.g. heterogenous join of client &amp; server datastores).</li></p>
<b><p align="justify"><li>MSMQ for Distributed Applications</b>.  MSMQ is a great example of a distributed technology where most of the value is in the services and implementation and NOT in the wire protocol.</li></p></ul>

</font><font face="Helvetica Black" size="3"><p>Leverage ISV's for system improvements</p>
</font><font face="Helvetica" size="3"><p align="justify">A key long term advantage that Linux will enjoy is the massive pool of developers willing to improve areas of the core platform.   Microsoft will never be able to employ a similar headcount.</p>
<p align="justify">A key mechanism to combat this is to make it easy (and provide incentives) for ISV's to extend system components in NT for custom, vertical applications.   One example here could be Veritas' specialized file system drivers for NT.</p>
</font><font face="Helvetica Black" size="3"><p>&quot;WinTone&quot;</p>
</font><font face="Helvetica" size="3"><p align="justify">Linux's modularity and customization also implies inconsistencies in services available on an arbitrary Linux installation.  Microsoft can provide a bundle of services that are universally available in all OS releases (current initiatives include WBEM-based management) that generate network externalities when combined across many devices in the network.</p>
<p align="justify">Put another way, the extreme modularity of Linux devalues what a &quot;Linux-logo'ed&quot; app means.   By contrast, Window's monolithic nature gives an app developer more leeway in terms of what API's are callable.</p></dir>

</font><font face="Helvetica" size="3"><p align="justify">Where is Microsoft vulnerable to Linux?  As stated earlier, the primary threat resides on the server vs. the client.</p>
</font><font face="Helvetica Black" size="3"><p>Linux will &quot;Cream Skim&quot; the Best NT Server Features</p>
</font><font face="Helvetica" size="3"><p align="justify">The Linux community is very willing to copy features from other OS's if it will serve their needs.   Consequently, there is the very real long term threat that as MS expends the development dollars to create a bevy of new features in NT, Linux will simply cherry pick the best features an incorporate them into their codebase.</p>
<p align="justify"><a name="quote9"><span class="highlight">The effect of patents and copyright in combatting Linux remains to be investigated.</span></a></p>
</font><font face="Helvetica Black" size="3"><p>Linux is recreating the MS &quot;3<sup>rd</sup> release is a charm&quot; advantage - FASTER</p>
</font><font face="Helvetica" size="3"><p align="justify">Microsoft's
market power doesn't stem from products as much as it does from our
iterative process.  The first release of a Microsoft product often
fairs poorly in the market and primarily of generates fine granularity
feedback from consumers.   Similarly, Linux has shown that they are
capable of iterative cycles - but at an order of magnitude faster
rate.  On the flip side, however, our incremental releases are
arguably much larger whereas many of Linux's incremental releases are
tantamount to pure bug fixing.</p>

Perish forbid that anyone should ever issue a release just to <em>fix
bugs</em>.
