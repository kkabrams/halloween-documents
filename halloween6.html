	<h1>Halloween Document VI</h1>
	
	<h2>The Fatal Anniversary</h2>
	
	<p>It is now just about exactly a year since the <a
href="index.html">Halloween Documents</a> were first released upon an
unsuspecting world.  Many things have changed; Linux 2.2 has gone from
promise to memory, the Halloween Documents' author has quit Microsoft
to go to work for a Linux-based startup, mainstream market-research
outfits like IDC now predict a 30% server-market share for Linux in
the near future, and the first Linux IPO rocketed Red Hat Software to
a six-billion-dollar market capitalization.  A few things have
remained the same; Windows is still buggy and insecure and crash-prone,
Windows 2000 still isn't shipping, and Microsoft is still making
excuses.</p>

<p>But perhaps the most dramatic development in the Halloween saga has
been a change in the axis of Microsoft spin. Ed <a
href="halloween4.html">"Sheriff of Nottingham"</a> Muth has quietly
disappeared from public view, perhaps having publicly tickled his
tonsils with his toenails once too often for King Billy's tolerance.
Instead, Microsoft has been trying to sandbag Linux with supposedly
"objective" studies by third parties that turn out to have been bought
and paid for by the boys in Redmond.</p>

<p>Fortunately, these tactics have been pursued with the same slap-happy
level of incompetence that made Sheriff Ed's antics so amusing.  The
<a href="http://slashdot.org/features/99/04/23/1316228.shtml">Mindcraft</a>
fiasco in March set a pattern continued by its sequels; Microsoft got
the benchmark results it wanted &#150; only to be embarrassed when it came
out that Mindcraft had apparently run them on Microsoft-supplied
machines, at a Microsoft site, with the benevolent assistance of
Microsoft technicians tuning both Windows and (even more helpfully)
Linux &#150; and then neglected to mention in its press release that
Microsoft had paid for and hosted the whole exercise.  Mindcraft's
credibility was, of course, utterly destroyed.</p>

<p>Mindcraft was just small fry, though &#150; one more tiny company who
learned too late that when Microsoft brings you flowers, they're
likely to end up decorating your grave one way or another.  As the
fatal anniversary of <a href="halloween1.html">Halloween I</a> loomed,
Microsoft appears to have rerun the same scam on a much larger scale.
This time, its date for the dance was a respected name in IT
forecasting, the Gartner Group.</p>

<p>Cue the ominous background music ...</p>

<p>Sometime before 6 October, the Gartner Group published on its central
corporate website, www.gartner.com, a series of five reports slamming
Linux and predicting that its appeal would fade once the inevitable
Service Pack 1 for Windows 2000 came out.  These reports quickly
spawned Linux-is-doomed articles like this <a
href="http://www2.idg.com.au/CWT1997.nsf/cwtoday/9A8CD41DF73CC94F4A25680A001C5F0C">
example from 15 Oct</a> on the IDG Australia website, which promoted
them as objective studies by independent Gartner.</p>

<p>The articles, however, included the following small print at the end:</p>

<blockquote>

	<p>Microsoft Web Letter is published by Microsoft. Additional editorial material supplied by Gartner Group, Inc. &copy; 1999.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>suggesting (though not proving) that this "Gartner report" was actually written and published by Microsoft on Gartner's own
website.</p>

<p>We can't tell you the exact date of the reports, because they aren't
there any more.  On 19 October Gartner <a
href="http://lwn.net/">changed the copyright</a> on the reports to no
longer mention Microsoft, while publicly insisting that the research
had not been funded by Microsoft.  Tellingly, however, the URLs of the
reports still began with this prefix:</p>

<div align="center">

<p><strong>http://www.gartner.com/webletter/microsoft/</strong></p>

</div>

<p>and the same copyright notice, with the same attribution to Microsoft, can
still be found on articles in the
<strong>webletter/microsoft/</strong> directory as this is written.
Sometime between 19 and 27 October yanked the reports off its site
entirely.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Rick Moen, a well-known Linux activist, managed to
recover them from his Netscape cache &#150; and found the copyright notice
reproduced above.  In view of Gartner's protestations that Microsoft had
nothing to do with funding the research, the next lines in the notice
are especially interesting:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Editorial supplied by Microsoft is independent of GartnerGroup analysis and in no way should this information be construed as a GartnerGroup endorsement of Microsoft's products and services.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>So.  At first blush, these "Gartner Group" reports seem to have been
a warm personal gesture from Microsoft Corporation to itself.  That
theory would fit both the copyright and the contents, which exactly
repeats Microsoft marketing cant that we've seen before &#150; including
such trademarks of the genre as the (unsupported and, according to
IDC, false) assertion that Linux is taking seats mainly from other
Unix shops.</p>

<p>However, the Gartner Group insists that
Microsoft did not write the reports. A spokesman
<a href="http://www2.idg.com.au/cwt1997.nsf/cwtoday/E526A87F6745E60D4A25680B00224F57">
explained</a> through the same compliant IDG Australia reporter
responsible for the 15 Oct Linux-is-doomed story.  Chase the link to
get a load of this spin-doctoring; no paraphrase by us could do
justice to the way Microsoft and the reporter deftly weave a fog of
soothing confusion around the contradictions in their story.  We're
supposed to believe that:</p>

<ul>

	<li>Gartner wrote the reports &#150; even though the copyrights on them
explicitly said otherwise;</li>
	<li>A set of URLs on www.gartner.com are "the
Microsoft site";</li>
	<li>Microsoft "sponsors" this "site", and paid unspecified fees to Gartner
Group related to the content &#150; but nevertheless, in no way did
Microsoft fund the reports.</li>

</ul>

<p>Rick's comment on their explanation is more eloquent than my own:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I'm sure [Gartner's denial] was truthful, if you squint at it the
right way: I'm certain that Microsoft Corporation's ongoing series of
cheques for sundry services and accommodations did not specify
(outright) that they were to fund a report that just by amazing
coincidence parrots Microsoft's exact party line about Linux, in fine
detail.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Quite.  Far be it from us to suggest that the Gartner Group has
fraudulently colluded with Microsoft, however suggestive the evidence.
Could it all have been some horrible mistake?  Could Gartner Group
have been innocently victimized by a Microsoft partisan in its own
ranks?  Perhaps one of these scenarios is why the reports quietly
disappeared &#150; but not before taking much of the Gartner Group's
credibility with them, alas.  Poor Gartner Group; the folks at
Mindcraft, I'm sure, would weep for them &#150; would deeply
sympathize.</p>

<p>Ah well.  Whatever occurred, I'm sure the large amounts of money that
Gartner admits to having received from Microsoft before and after this
incident have done much to soothe their upset at looking like
patsies.</p>

<p>While the Gartner Group was busily issuing denials, Microsoft was
publishing yet another attack document, the <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/nts/news/msnw/LinuxMyths.asp">Linux
Myths</a> page.  The Myths page
has been well <a
href="http://lwn.net/1999/features/MSResponse.phtml">debunked</a>
elsewhere, but its technical weight is less relevant here than the
fact that it cited the Gartner
Group reports as a supporting third-party analysis.
The references are still there, even though the
reports are gone. Perhaps this was the point of the exercise for
whoever actually wrote the reports?</p>

<p>And while all this was going on, a Linux-vs.-NT study that never had a
Microsoft copyright on it was being done by a firm that doesn't take a
retainer from Microsoft; Bloor Research.  The results in their
<a href="http://www.newsalert.com/bin/story?StoryId=CoaVSWcSbotqWmZuZntK3">
19 October announcement</a> are consistent with the results of many
other third-party studies such as John Kirch's <a
href="http://www.unix-vs-nt.org/">Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0
versus UNIX</a>. They said "The verdict is clearly in favour of
Linux."</p>
