<h1 class="c1">Halloween VIII: Doing the Damage-Control Dance</h1>

<p>Everybody remember the Gandhi quote?</p>

<blockquote>
First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, 
then they fight you, then you win.
</blockquote>

<p>Gentlemen and ladies, this newest leaked memo from Microsoft
confirms that we are advancing through GandhiCon Three.</p>  

<p>As usual,
highlights are in <span class="highlight">this color</span> and comments are
in <span class="commentcolor">{this color, also bracketed for the
color-blind}</span>.  Also as usual, the memo is otherwise unedited
and exactly as I received it, with one exception: in the text version
I was sent, the last bullet item was inexplicably positioned
<em>after</em> the sender sig "Orlando".</p>

<p>Some analysis follows the memo.</p>

<hr>
From: Orlando Ayala<br/> 
Sent: Monday, November 25, 2002 5:22 AM<br/> 
To: GMs of Subsidiaries<br/> 
Cc: Mich Mathews; Mike Nash; Craig Mundie; Brad Smith (LCA); Pamela Passman (LCA); Vivek Varma; Orlando Ayala's Direct Reports<br/> 
Subject: OSS and Goverment<br/>

<span class="comment"><p>{Probably LCA = "Law and Corporate Affairs".
Passman's bio suggests this interpretation.</p></span>

<p>We need to more effectively respond to press reports regarding
Governments and other major institutions considering OSS alternatives
to our products.  <span class="highlight">We must be prepared to
respond to announcements,</span> such as this one by the Japan
Government (or prior announcements in Peru, Germany etc) quickly and
with facts to counter the perception that large institutions are
deploying OSS or Linux, when they are only considering or just
piloting the technology. Announcements by governments are reported
quickly around the world and require more coordination. In several
instances, <span class="highlight">our ability to communicate
effectively has been hindered by a lack of integration across groups
in Redmond and the subsidiaries.</span></p>

<span class="comment"><p>{Translation: We can expect a lot more OSS
adoption announcements.  This deer-caught-in-the-headlights
paralysis thing has got to stop!}</p></span>

<p>What to Escalate: Any instance of government organizations and
significant corporate customers who are planning to study, support or
deploy OSS including <span class="highlight">Linux and Star
Office</span> that is likely to generate media attention (as
differentiated from the COMPHOT alias). Any media coverage detailing
the <span class="highlight">real or expected</span> announcement of a
government organization of corporate customer to study, support or
deploy OSS.</p>

<span class="comment"><p>{Translation: The peasantry is getting restless.
Not only must we be prepared to deploy massive armadas of marketing
suits to squelch "real" unrest, we must begin jumping at "expected"
shadows.}</p></span>

<span class="comment"><p>{COMPHOT would appear to be another mailing list,
possibly one devoted to competitive hot spots.  Isn't it interesting that it's
the combined attack on the OS monopoly and office-suite monopoly that
really worries them?  And they're missing a trick. The real threat 
isn't StarOffice, which they could scuttle by taking out Sun.  The real
threat is <a href="http://openoffice.org">OpenOffice</a>.}</p></span>

<p>How to Escalate: Send an email immediately (same day) to the OSSI
alias. This group includes members from the Security Business Unit,
Server Marketing, LCA and Corporate PR who can quickly pull in
additional stakeholders, influence business decisions, create and
communicate PR guidance. Your mail should include the following
information:</p>

<span class="comment"><p>{Translation: we have a high-level
damage-control group knit together with an "OSSI" mailing list that
everybody in the To line knows enough about that we don't have to give
its full name.}</p></span>

<ul>
<li>Designate the subsidiary owner (s) and their 24 hour contact
information</li>

<li>Explain the overall validity of claim, what is being reported,
what is true/false</li>

<li>Explain how and where the organization fits within govt structure
(is it a small/medium/large department, how much influence does it
have on other IT decisions, are their political influences at play, is
there a commitment to deploy, what are the specific details of the
announcement, what are the next steps)</li>

<li>Explain likely influences, bottom line reasoning on why this is
happening (i.e. security, cost, politics)</li>

<span class="comment"><p>{Translation: They could be moving because
our software's security sucks dead maggots through a straw, or because
our licensing terms are highway robbery and <a
href="http://boston.internet.com/news/print.php/1485861">feloniously
illegal</a> in some jurisdictions, or because some politician got a
nationalistic bug up his ass.  Better pray it's the last, because if it's
either of the first two we are <em>completely</em>
screwed.}</p></span>

<li>Explain Microsoft's presence in the account</li>

<li>Name the key contacts within the gov't</li>

<span class="comment"><p>{Translation: Who can we suborn?}</p></span>

<li>Name available third parties/potential defenders</li>

<span class="comment"><p>{Translation: Who are our <a
href="halloween6.php">paid
shills</a> and astroturfers this week?}</p></span>

<li>Provide detail on the writer and their media who are writing the story, i.e. are they technical, political, sensational</li>

<span class="comment"><p>{Translation: Find out if we can shoot the
messenger, dammit!}</p></span>

</ul>
 

<p>The Commitment From Corporate:</p>

<ul>
<li>Deliver, at minimum, guidance and messaging regarding any new instance within the same business day of your mail being received, including WW communication to prepare all subs</li>

<span class="comment"><p>{WW probably equals "World Wide" here. "subs"
= "subsidiaries"}</p></span>

<li>Follow up with additional guidance, messaging and content within a second business day, including customer and government communication tools</li>

<span class="comment"><p>{Translation: we don't expect the stuff we
gave you on the first business day to have actually helped.}</p></span>

<li>ecome much better in giving messaging and content proactively on OSS and Linux related issues.  </li>

<span class="comment"><p>{We'll start by learning how to type the word
"become" correctly.  We promise.}</p></span>

<li>Todd and MarkM to coordinate with SueB on Mike Nash participation in Linux business press tour</li> 

<span class="comment"><p>{Translation: We don't think enough of our
big customers understand that we consider Linux a major competitive threat,
so we're going to send Mike Nash on a press tour to introduce it to
them.}</p></span>

</ul>

<p>Orlando Ayala is the Group Vice President of Microsoft's Worldwide
Sales, Marketing and Services Group.  For a good indication of the
sterling quality of human being we are dealing with here, read this <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/ayala/07-14fusion.asp">buzzword-suffused
speech</a>. There are bios of Ayala and the recipients <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/"> on the Microsoft
site</a>.</p>

<p>This is an unusual Halloween memorandum in that it's not
particularly redolent of evil.  It's a reactionary memo about trying to become
less reactionary, the sort of thing that gets churned out daily by
clueless corporate droids everywhere.  They're tired of constantly
being caught by surprise and want to do something about it. </p>

<p>Out here in open-source land, we genuinely enjoy helping our fellow
sophonts out of plights like this one.  Might we suggest that daily
monitoring of the Linux User Group of Davis's <a
href="http://www.lugod.org/microsoft">Reasons to Avoid Microsoft</a>
page would be helpful?</p>

<p>In public, Microsoft is now focusing on the cost argument, having
lost last February's argument about security when the Gartner Group
told its customers to <a
href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/archive/21853.html">stay
the hell away from IIS</a> because it has insoluble security
problems. This memorandum reveals that they're fully aware not merely of the
security and <a
href="http://news.com.com/2100-1001-947164.html">cost</a> problems, but also
of the problem of revolt by sovereign governments against Microsoft
hegemony.  It makes especially interesting reading in combination with
<a href="halloween7.php">Halloween
VII</a>.</p>

<p>Which leaves us with one burning question: whatever happened to <a
href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010211142733/http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/nts/news/mwarv/linuxresp.asp">Ed Muth</a>?
He was <em>fun</em> to play with!  He appears to have become a
non-person on the Microsoft website, and there is some evidence they
may have demoted him and exiled him to <a
href="http://www.insto.com.au/conf_1002_speakers.php">Australia</a>.</p>
