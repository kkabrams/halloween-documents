SCO complaint against IBM filed on 16 June 2003</a> is, like its
predecessor, a tissue of lies, deliberate distortions, and flimflam.
This complaint strongly suggests that SCO has no real case, since
it contains so many false and misleading statements.  Instead, it
appears that SCO is trying to turn worthless products into money
by running up the stock price on false claims and/or
trying to get bought out so the frivolous legal actions will stop.</p><p class="framing">
Unlike its predecessor, this amended complaint has been brought to you
by the generosity of Microsoft, who (on the evidence of SCO's 10-Q SEC
filings) dropped at least six million dollars on SCO (plus a promise
of five million more over the next three quarters) to help it make
trouble for Linux.</p><p class="framing">SCO, having willingly made itself a sock puppet
for the boys in Redmond, therefore becomes the first company other
than Microsoft to have its utterances admitted to the gallery of
infamy that is the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/halloween/" target="_top">Halloween

information which third parties may verify by chasing links or through
their local library.</p><p class="framing">Text in <span class="complaint">fixed-width

</pre><p class="complaint">Plaintiff, The SCO Group, Inc., a Delaware
corporation, <span class="highlight">f/k/a Caldera Systems, Inc</span>.
(&#8220;SCO&#8221;), sues Defendant International Business Machines Corporation
(&#8220;IBM&#8221;) and alleges as follows:</p><p class="comment">The plaintiff in this case, <a href="http://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&amp;CIK=0001102542&amp;owner=include" target="_top">&quot;SCO
Group Inc.&quot;</a>, was originally the Linux vendor &quot;Caldera Systems
Inc.&quot;  It changed its name to &quot;Caldera International Inc.&quot; on October
11, 2000 after purchasing the server division of The Santa Cruz
Operation, and changed its name again to &quot;SCO Group Inc.&quot; on May
15, 2003.  The original SCO changed its name to <a href="http://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?CIK=851560&amp;owner=include&amp;action=getcompany" target="_top">&quot;Tarantella
Inc&quot;</a> on February 12, 2001 after divesting itself of its
deteriorating Unix business to focus on its Tarantella
application.</p><p class="comment">These are two distinct companies, one founded in 1979 and
headquartered in California, and the other founded in 1994 and
headquartered in Utah, which the plaintiff refers to interchangeably
as SCO.  To distinguish them, we refer to the plaintiff as SCO/Caldera
and the older company the plaintiff purchased a server division from
as SCO/Tarantella.</p><p class="comment">For the sad tale of Caldera's degeneration from
an open-source pioneer to a parasitic lawsuit factory, see
<a href="#decline_and_fall" title="A. The Decline and Fall of Caldera">Appendix A</a>.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2791248"></a>Nature of This Action</h2></div></div><p class="complaint">1.  UNIX is <span class="highlight">a computer
operating system program</span> and related software originally
developed by AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories
(&#8220;AT&amp;T&#8221;). UNIX is widely used in the corporate, or
&#8220;enterprise,&#8221; computing environment.</p><p class="comment">Actually, &#8216;UNIX&#8217; is not
&#8220;a computer operating system program&#8221;.  There is no single
operating system you can point to and say &quot;that alone is Unix, everything
else is not Unix&quot;.  Technically, the name &quot;Unix&quot; is a <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/comm/press/who-owns-unix.htm" target="_top">trademark
of The Open Group</a> describing a group of operating systems
conforming to The Open Group's &#8216;Single Unix Specification&#8217;.
More generally, Unix is a generic technical term used to describe a family of
over a hundred operating systems, some of which meet The Open Group's
trademark standard but many of which do not.  Compaq's Tru64 was submitted and
<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/csq/view.mhtml?norationale=1&amp;noreferences=1&amp;RID=dec%2FXU2%2F1" target="_top">qualified for the Unix trademark</a>,
while Apple uses Unix in a generic sense when referring to
its <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/" target="_top">MacOS X</a>.  Microsoft's
Windows NT has hosted a Unix compatibility environment called
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/" target="_top">cygwin</a> since <a href="http://cygwin.com/history.html" target="_top">1998</a>, allowing it to run Unix software.</p><p class="comment">While all Unixes in either sense share common
ideas and methods, the ideas and methods they share are (and for twenty
years have been) part of the common state of engineering art in the
construction of operating systems, extensively documented in the
public literature, and shared by a global community of hundreds of
thousands of programmers and software engineers.  The first paragraph
of this complaint is the beginning of a deliberate, mendacious attempt
to misrepresent this entire body of work as SCO's property.</p><p class="comment">SCO does not even own the Unix trademark, and they
cannot be be ignorant of The Open Group, since <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/overview/members/membership_list.htm" target="_top">both
SCO and IBM are members</a>.  IBM is one of five &quot;Sponsors&quot;, and
SCO is one of 138 &quot;Regular Members&quot; &#8212; IBM's membership in The Open Group
significantly outranks SCO's.</p><p class="comment">SCO itself does not offer a product named just
&#8216;Unix&#8217;, it offers UnixWare (named after Novell Netware)
and SCO OpenServer (which was once Microsoft Xenix).</p><p class="comment">Over the past 30 years, the basic ideas of Unix have
permeated every aspect of the software industry.  In 1996, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/billgates/speeches/industry&amp;tech/uexpo.asp" target="_top">Microsoft
CEO Bill Gates gave a speech at Unix Expo</a> where he called Windows
NT &quot;a form of Unix&quot;.  The same &quot;UNIX
95&quot; certification <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/csq/view.mhtml?RID=sco%2FXU1%2F9" target="_top">SCO
obtained for UnixWare</a> was also granted to <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/csq/view.mhtml?RID=ibm%2FXU1%2F2" target="_top">IBM's
OS/390</a> mainframe operating system.  A decade ago, IBM's OS/2 operating
system for the PS/2 had an <a href="http://homepages.tu-darmstadt.de/~st002279/os2/porting.html" target="_top">open source Unix emulation package called EMX</a> (which was
not created by IBM, but by a german individual named Eberhard Mattes).</p><p class="comment">Over the past 30 years, the basic ideas of Unix have
permeated every aspect of the software industry.  In 1996, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/billgates/speeches/industry&amp;tech/uexpo.asp" target="_top">Microsoft
CEO Bill Gates gave a speech at Unix Expo</a> where he called Windows
NT &quot;a form of Unix&quot;.</p><p class="complaint">2.  Through a series of corporate acquisitions,
SCO presently <span class="highlight">owns all right, title and
interest in and to UNIX</span> and UnixWare operating system source
code, software and sublicensing agreements, together with copyrights,
additional licensing rights in and to UNIX and UnixWare, and claims
against all parties breaching such agreements.  <span class="highlight">Through agreements with UNIX vendors</span>, SCO
controls the right of all UNIX vendors to use and distribute UNIX.
These restrictions on the use and distribution of UNIX are designed to
<span class="highlight">protect the economic value of UNIX</span>.</p><p class="comment">The &#8220;series of corporate
acquisitions&#8221; draws a kindly veil over the fact that at least
three different companies &#8212; AT&amp;T, Novell, and the original
SCO (now Tarantella) &#8212; have each discarded the rights to the
increasingly obsolete System V codebase.  Along the way, the
intellectual property was significantly impaired.</p><p class="comment">The most obvious impairment of SCO's
&#8220;right and title&#8221; to Unix source code and related IP is
the 1993 settlement with the University of California at Berkeley,
which legally confirmed the plurity of Unix by severing the BSD source
base, despite its origin as a derivative work of AT&amp;T code, from
the control of AT&amp;T's successors in interest.</p><p class="comment">USL's willingness to settle the lawsuit, <a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/bsdi/bsdisuit.html" target="_top">&quot;Unix
System Laboratories v. Berkeley Software Design, Inc.&quot;</a> (1993
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19503; 27 U.S.P.Q.2D (BNA) 1721.), was motivated by
the judge's <a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/bsdi/930303.ruling.txt" target="_top">ruling
against issuing a preliminary injunction</a>, which read in part:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="comment">Since Plaintiff has failed to
provide enough evidence to establish a &quot;reasonable probability&quot; that
Net2 or BSD/386 contain trade secrets, I find that Plaintiff has
failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of its
claim for misappropriation of trade secrets.  No preliminary
injunction will issue.</p></blockquote></div><p class="comment">The settlement resulted in the release of
4.3-Lite BSD, an open-source version of Unix explicitly free of any
intellectual property claims from AT&amp;T or its successors.  The
existence of unimpaired BSD imposed a massive new burden on any
intellectual property claims putatively based on ownership of the
System V code: to prove that any disputed IP could not have come from
BSD.</p><p class="comment">Another significant source of impairment is the
plethora of existing &quot;perpetual&quot; Unix licenses.  These licenses were
granted in return for a one-time payment requiring no ongoing
royalties; they never expire, and they allow unlimited sublicensing
and the creation of derivative works that explicitly belong to the
licensee.  IBM's original license to System V technology from AT&amp;T
is such a license, as shown by language in <a href="http://www.sco.com/scosource/ExhibitC.qxd.pdf" target="_top">&quot;Exhibit C&quot;</a>
on SCO's own website, which is an amendment/clarification of IBM's
System V contract.  Paragraph 2 of Exhibit C explicitly allows IBM to
create derivative works, and affirms that those derivative works
belong entirely to IBM (except for any actual System V code snippets
included in them, if any).</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="comment">Regarding Section 2.01, we agree that
modifications and derivative works prepared by or for you are owned by
you.  However, ownership of any portion or portions of SOFTWARE
PRODUCTS included in any such modification or derivative work remains
with us.</p></blockquote></div><p class="comment">Although IBM's perpetual System V code license
was with AT&amp;T, SCO is still selling these perpetual licenses as
the core offering of their SCOsource initiative.  The second full
paragraph on page 28 of their <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102542/000110465903012299/j2045_10q.htm" target="_top">2003
first quarter SEC filing</a> begins:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="comment">Our SCOsource licensing revenue to
date has been generated from license agreements that are
non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free, paid up licenses to utilize
our UNIX source code, including the right to
sublicense.</p></blockquote></div><p class="comment">A third source of impairment is the simple fact
that tens of thousands of copies of Unix source code have been
circulating within the community for three decades.  SCO itself puts
the number at over 30,000 licensing agreements with 6000 entities
(from the same <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102542/000110465903012299/j2045_10q.htm" target="_top">2003
Q1 SEC filing</a>, bottom of page 20).  Maintaining trade secret
status on something like that is effectively impossible.  One of the
authors of this commentary is <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/nosecrets/" target="_top">collecting evidence</a>
from senior Unix gurus who have source code to System V and derivatives in
their archives, to prove that this code cannot have trade secret
status.</p><p class="comment">It is worth noting that when SCO says
&#8220;These restrictions on the use and distribution of UNIX are
designed to protect the economic value of UNIX.&#8221; it is using the
phrase &#8220;economic value&#8221; in a tendentious way.  No action
of IBM has altered the economic value of Unix; a copy of Unix has much
the same effect on a user's ability to process data and do things as
it did before any of IBM's actions.  The <span class="emphasis"><em>price</em></span> that
can be charged for that value, the amount of rent SCO can collect, has
been diminishing for years, but this is nothing new.  <a href="http://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&amp;CIK=0001102542&amp;owner=include" target="_top">SCO's
own SEC filings</a> have proposed a number of alternative
hypotheses for their poor economic performance, and before 2003
SCO/Caldera had never had a single profitable quarter.  They're not
complaining about the loss of actual revenue, but about the loss of a purely
hypothetical market opportunity that might conceivably have resulted in
revenue.</p><p class="complaint">3.  A <span class="highlight">variant or
clone</span> of UNIX currently exists in the computer marketplace
called &#8220;Linux.&#8221; Linux is, in material part, based upon
UNIX source code and methods, particularly as related to enterprise
computing methods found in Linux 2.4.x releases and the current
development kernel, Linux 2.5.x.  Significantly, Linux is distributed
without a licensing fee and without proprietary rights of ownership or
confidentiality.</p><p class="comment">Referring to Linux as a &#8220;clone&#8221;
presumes the conclusion SCO wishes the court to reach.  Linux is not
in essence a clone or derivative work of any SCO property, but an autonomous
line of evolution of generic, publicly documented Unix ideas, with a history
of independent development documented back to its beginnings.  Even a
showing that Linux incidentally or accidentally contained some Unix
code would not alter Linux's essential nature as an independent
work.</p><p class="comment">Linus Torvalds explained the situation in the chapter
he wrote for the 1999 book &quot;Open Sources&quot; (the complete text of which is
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/linus.html" target="_top">available online</a>):
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="comment">Linux is a Unix-like operating system, but not a version of Unix. This gives Linux a different heritage than, for example, Free BSD. What I mean is this: the creators of Free BSD started with the source code to Berkeley Unix, and their kernel is directly descended from that source code. So Free BSD is a version of Unix; it's in the Unix family tree. Linux, on the other hand, aims to provide an interface that is compatible with Unix, but the kernel was written from scratch, without reference to Unix source code. So Linux itself is not a port of Unix. It's a new operating system.</p></blockquote></div><p class="comment">A <a href="http://www.li.org/linuxhistory.php" target="_top">quick summary</a> of
early Linux development circa 1991 and 1992 is available from Linux
International.  (Notice that the first documentary evidence of the
Linux project on the internet was Linus Torvalds asking for a copy of
the Posix standard, not for source code.)  The Linux development process has

for Fun&quot;</a>, by Linus Torvalds and David Diamond, covers the
early days of Linux in detail.  Linus created Linux shortly after
taking a course on operating system design from the University of
Helsinki, which used the textbook <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0136386776/qid=1056126796/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/104-1930051-2433544?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846" target="_top">Operating
Systems: Design and Implementation</a> by Dr. Andrew Tanenbaum,
which was about a tiny unix-like operating system called &quot;Minix&quot; which
Tanenbaum had written from scratch as a teaching tool.
<sup>[<a name="id2791894" href="#ftn.id2791894">1</a>]</sup> Linus chose a very different design from
Minix, and used no Minix code in Linux, even though Minix itself was
an independent work of Tanenbaum's which contained no System V code.
As Linux became more popular, Tanenbaum publicly disagreed with Linus'
design choices, and a subsequent public debate took place on the
internet in January 1992 between <a href="http://www.dina.dk/~abraham/Linus_vs_Tanenbaum.html" target="_top">Tanenbaum
and Torvalds</a> on operating system design principles.  The

confuse the widely admitted sharing of ideas and methods among computer
professionals and Unix-family operating systems with putatively illicit
misappropriation of source code.  This attempt begins here with the
introduction of the term &#8220;methods&#8221; But the history is clear;
Linux could be &#8220;based on&#8221; Unix methods through published treatment
such as Maurice Bach's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0132017997/qid=1056127348/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-1930051-2433544?v=glance&amp;s=books" target="_top">The

legal connection to or proprietary entitlement by AT&amp;T's
successors in interest.</p><p class="comment">During the months since its initial complaint
was filed, SCO has repeatedly refused to make public any actual
evidence that Linux is &#8220;in material part, based upon UNIX source
code&#8221;, preferring instead to trumpet its claims in the media.
(Their one gesture in the direction of disclosure, at SCOforum in
August 2003, proved to be of code they don't own.) In any case, given
that the revision history of the SCO source code is
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> (unlike that of Linux) a matter of public
record readily accessible on numerous archives, the burden should be
on SCO to show that any similarities have not been covertly and
deliberately inserted by SCO itself for the purpose of enabling SCO to
commit barratry against IBM and the Linux community at large.</p><p class="complaint">4.  The UNIX software distribution vendors,
such as IBM, are contractually and legally prohibited from giving away
or disclosing <span class="highlight">proprietary UNIX source code
and methods</span> for external business purposes, such as
contributions to the Linux community or otherwise using UNIX for the
benefit of others.  <span class="highlight">This prohibition extends to
derivative work products that are modifications of, or based on, UNIX System V
source code or technology.</span>  IBM and certain other UNIX software
distributors are violating this prohibition, en masse, as though no prohibition
or proprietary restrictions exist at all with respect to the UNIX
technology.  As a result of IBM's wholesale disregard of its
contractual and legal obligations to SCO, <span class="highlight">Linux 2.4.x and the development Linux kernel, 2.5.x,
are filled with UNIX source code, derivative works and
methods</span>.  As such, Linux 2.4.x and Linux 2.5.x are
unauthorized derivatives of UNIX System V.</p><p class="comment">This paragraph begins with a sleight of hand. By
using the phrase &#8220;proprietary Unix source code and
methods&#8221; in a way that leaves it ambiguous whether
&#8220;proprietary&#8221; is a restrictive modifier or not, SCO
attempts to confuse a trivial but true claim (disclosure of
proprietary methods is forbidden) with an extremely broad and false
claim (disclosure of Unix methods is forbidden).</p><p class="comment">But, in fact, it has not been shown that there
are <span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> proprietary methods or any proprietary
source code at issue.  SCO holds no Unix patents; the state and
disposition of the Unix copyrights is unclear and presently disputed
between SCO and Novell; finally, by making the source code
&#8220;readily ascertainable by proper means&#8221; including the
sale of source licenses to educational institutions, SCO and various
predecessors in interest have failed to meet the Utah standards for
maintenance of trade secrecy in the Unix source code.  Their &quot;trade
secrets&quot; have been taught in college classes for 20 years, with their
knowledge and approval.</p><p class="comment">On August 18 2003 at the annual SCOforum show,
SCO tried to back up its contention that Linux is &#8220;filled with
UNIX source code, derivative works and methods&#8221; &#8212; and was
promptly <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/smoking-fizzle.html" target="_top">shot
down</a>.</p><p class="comment">As for derivative works, SCO needs to read its own
Exhibit C, paragraph 2, which states &#8220;...modifications and derivative
works prepared by or for you are owned by you.&#8221;.  (The
&#8220;you&#8221; in this case being IBM.)  More on this in the response to
paragraph 6.</p><p class="comment">As a final point, the moment that SCO shipped a
Linux kernel containing any included System V code, it knowingly put
that code under the terms of the GNU General Public License, and that
code thereby <span class="emphasis"><em>ceased</em></span> to be proprietary (and if
SCO/Caldera did not accept the GPL, then they willfully violated the
copyrights of every single Linux contributor).  SCO and predecessor in
interest Caldera shipped Linux source code for eight years, and joined
numerous Linux development consortia including <a href="http://www.caldera.com/company/press/19991213trillian.html" target="_top">The
Trillian Project</a> and <a href="http://www.caldera.com/unitedlinux" target="_top">United Linux</a>.
Although SCO tried to cover its tracks by <a href="http://ir.sco.com/ReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=109149" target="_top">suspending
distribution of its own Linux product</a> two months after filing
its lawsuit against IBM, Linux source code is <a href="ftp://ftp.caldera.com/pub/OpenLinux311/Server/SRPMS" target="_top">still
available for download</a> from SCO, and must remain so for three
years according to the terms of secton 3 of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html" target="_top">GNU General Public
License</a> under which Linux was made available to SCO/Caldera
for distribution.  SCO/Caldera complied with its obligations under the
GPL for eight years, and can hardly start claiming it was unaware of
the terms of that license, since they submitted a complete copy of the
GPL to the securities and exchange commission (attached as exhibit
10.14 to their S-1 Inital Public Offering filing <sup>[<a name="id2789451" href="#ftn.id2789451">2</a>]</sup>).  The GPL was also the contract under
which they sold Linux to their customers, thereby binding themselves
to an obligation to those customers.
</p><p class="comment">SCO voluntarily chose to participate in the
Linux market.  It was never required by any third party to do so, and
found doing so profitable (in gross terms, if not net).  If SCO didn't exert
due diligence on the code
SCO itself shipped, it can't blame IBM.  In fact, Linux was
SCO/Caldera's core business before it purchased the archaic Unix line
from SCO/Tarantella three years ago.  When Caldera first acquired SCO, its SEC
filings stated the intention to &#8220;unify&#8221; the Linux and Unix lines,
specifically questions 29 and 31 of <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102542/000095013400006197/e425.txt" target="_top">the
question and answer session</a>:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="comment">29. How will the products of both companies be
integrated?</p><p class="comment">We will integrate all products as appropriate based on
Caldera, Inc.'s focus of common application, development and management.</p><p class="comment">31. How will this affect the Linux
industry/community?</p><p class="comment">Caldera, Inc. intends to unify the technologies of Linux
and UNIX enhancing the attractiveness to Linux and business customers. In
addition, Caldera, Inc. will provide open access to those technologies,
greatly benefiting the Linux community and industry.</p></blockquote></div><p class="comment">Finally, this paragraph concludes with an
attempt to parlay a narrow claim of IBM contract violations into a
blatant land grab against all current versions of Linux, including
millions of lines of code which are not derived from System V code by
any standard, however inclusive. This is overreaching of the crudest
sort.</p><p class="complaint">5.  As set forth in more detail below, IBM has
breached its obligations to SCO, induced and encouraged others to
breach their obligations to SCO, interfered with SCO's business,
and engaged in unfair competition with SCO, including by:</p><p class="complaint">a) misusing UNIX software licensed by SCO to
IBM and Sequent;</p><p class="complaint">b) inducing, encouraging, and enabling others
to misuse and misappropriate SCO's proprietary software;
and</p><p class="complaint">c) incorporating (and inducing, encouraging,
and enabling others to incorporate) SCO's proprietary software
into Linux open-source software offerings.</p><p class="comment">In this summary of claims SCO speaks only of
software, not of methods or algorithms.  The implied breach is of
SCO's copyrights (if any).  Elsewhere, however, SCO speaks of methods.
The effect is to deliberately confuse two issues and prejudice claims
which SCO could not otherwise establish.</p><p class="complaint">6.  As a result of these breaches, SCO sent a
notice of termination to Mr. Sam Palmisano, the Chief Executive
Officer of IBM on March 6, 2003. The termination notice specified
that, pursuant to SCO's contractual rights under controlling
agreements, IBM's right to use or distribute any software product
based on UNIX System V technology, including its own version of UNIX
known as &#8220;AIX,&#8221; would be terminated on June 13, 2003,
unless such breaches were reasonably cured prior to that time.</p><p class="comment">IBM has pointed to the
plain language of its license agreement as a refutation of any claim
of breach.  This language, from <a href="http://www.sco.com/scosource/ExhibitC.qxd.pdf" target="_top">Exhibit
C</a>, includes the following in paragraph 9:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="comment">Nothing in this agreement shall
prevent LICENSEE from developing or marketing products or services
employing ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques relating to data
processing embodied in SOFTWARE PRODUCTS subject to this agreement,
provided that LICENSEE shall not copy any code from such SOFTWARE
PRODUCTS into any such product [...] If information relating to a
SOFTWARE PRODUCT subject to this agreement at any time becomes
available without restriction to the general public by acts not
attributable to LICENSEE or its employees, LICENSEE's obligations
under this section shall not apply to such information after such
time.&#8212;</p></blockquote></div><p class="comment">Since SCO itself ensured that any System V code
in Linux would become available without restriction to the general
public by shipping it in a Linux kernel for eight years (up through
version 2.4.14), the conditions of this language have been met.  In
addition, the source code for Unix System III, an earlier version of
Unix containing a significant subset of the later System V code, was
made available for free download on SCO's website under a
click-through <a href="http://shop.caldera.com/caldera/ancient.html" target="_top">&quot;Ancient Products
License&quot;</a>.  And the BSD lawsuit confirmed the release of a significant
portion of the methods, if not the actual code, of System V Unix.</p><p class="complaint">7.  The termination notice was based, in part,
on IBM's self-proclaimed contributions of AIX source code to
Linux, and use of UNIX/AIX methods for accelerating the development of
Linux in contravention of IBM's contractual obligations to
SCO.</p><p class="comment">IBM's license entitles it to use Unix
concepts and methods, to make derivative works, and to sublicense Unix
source code and technologies to others.</p><p class="comment">If SCO is going to try to quote IBM's marketing
people out of context, the obvious response is to quote SCO's CEO in
context.  The CEO of Caldera during the SCO acquisition and for a
number of years afterwards was Ransom Love.  An <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/story/0%2C%2Ct269-s2093314%2C00.html" target="_top">interview
Ransom Love gave in August 2001</a> (a year after the SCO
acquisition) includes several interesting statements.  In answer to
the question &#8220;What is your position [on open source] now?&#8221;,
Love replied &#8220;Caldera is absolutely committed to open
source... We are going to continue publishing under open source.&#8221;  In
answer to the question &quot;What does the future hold for your unified
Linux/Unix platform?&quot;, Love replied &quot;With UnixWare we can now take
Linux to 32-way systems...  So we are taking both and combining them
into one platform.&quot;  When asked about OpenServer, Love said &quot;...what
we plan to do is to take the OpenServer technology to Linux, probably
with some sort of open source source licence...&quot;  When asked &quot;What
does the recent acquisition of SCO really mean for Caldera?&quot;, Love
replied &quot;Our mission is to enable development, deployment and
management of a unified Linux and Unix operating system.&quot;</p><p class="comment">If the current management of SCO is completely
unaware of what their CEO claimed the company's mission was two years
ago, they are incompetent.  If they are aware of it, they're being
blatantly dishonest.  SCO/Caldera
<a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102542/000095013401002627/d85424e425.txt" target="_top">devoted entire securities and exchange commission filings</a>
 to unifying Linux and Unix.</p><p class="complaint">8.  Pursuant to its rights under the
controlling agreements, IBM was entitled to 100 days to cure its
underlying contractual breaches, provided it was willing and able to
do so.  Both parties were contractually required to &#8220;exert their
mutual good faith best efforts to resolve any alleged breach short of
termination.&#8221;</p><p class="comment">Nowhere does SCO specify exactly what actions SCO
wanted IBM to undertake.  What, specifically, did SCO want IBM to
do?  It can't have wanted IBM to remove offending code from the Linux
Kernel, because it refuses to reveal to IBM or the Linux community which code
it considers to be infringing.  SCO CEO Darl McBride
<a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1016_3-999371.html" target="_top">explained his
reason for refusing to identify allegedly infringing code in the Linux
kernel</a> as follows: &quot;The Linux community would have me publish it now,
(so they can have it) laundered by the time we can get to a court hearing.
That's not the way we're going to go.&quot;  SCO actively does not want IBM
or other Linux participants to stop infringing, and has intentionally made
it impossible for them to comply with SCO's stated wishes.  This cannot
be considered a good faith best effort on SCO's part.</p><p class="complaint">9.  To that end, SCO did everything reasonably
in its power to exert a good faith effort to resolve the termination
of IBM's UNIX contract rights.  Conversely, during the 100-day
period, IBM did not set forth a single proposal or idea for
cure.</p><p class="comment">SCO's phrasing here is particularly misleading.
Notice they don't say they made any effort to
<span class="emphasis"><em>avoid</em></span> the termination of IBM's contract.  In this
context, &#8220;resolve&#8221; means &#8220;enact&#8221;, or
&#8220;hasten&#8221;.  The contract language (again in Exhibit C,
paragraph 5 this time) forced them to wait 100 days.  It's too bad
that SCO's promise not to terminate for &#8220;breaches we consider to
be immaterial&#8221; didn't require arbitration by a disinterested
third party.  Asking SCO to judge what is and isn't immaterial is like
asking the fox to guard your chickens.</p><p class="comment">As for the rest of the paragraph, IBM has
maintained that there is no breach.  Where there is no breach, there
is no need for cure.</p><p class="complaint">10.  SCO has therefore terminated IBM's
right to use any part of the UNIX System V source code, including its
derivative AIX, effective as of June 13, 2003 (the &#8220;AIX
Termination Date&#8221;).</p><p class="complaint">11.  As of the AIX Termination Date, IBM is
contractually obligated to discontinue use of and return or destroy
any and all copies of the Software Products defined in the controlling
agreements, which include UNIX System V source code and all its
derivatives, including AIX.</p><p class="comment">As a matter of public record, IBM has
maintained that its license is perpetual and irrevocable. This
position is based on the language of <a href="http://www.sco.com/scosource/ExhibitD.qxd.pdf" target="_top">Amendment
X</a>, dated 1996.</p><p class="comment">It's also interesting to note that that the
&#8220;perpetual&#8221; licenses that SCO is offering through
SCOsource are the same general kind of license: that is, they seem
only to be guaranteed to last until SCO needs money.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2789961"></a>Parties, Jurisdiction and Venue</h2></div></div><p class="complaint">12.  Plaintiff SCO is a Delaware corporation

left Intel to work on parallel computing.  Their first product, released
in 1984, ran a modified version of BSD called Dynix.  Their first Intel 80386

Sequent shifted from BSD to System V in response to the uncertain legal
status of the BSD code before the USL vs BSD lawsuit was resolved.  The
(theoretically) System V based product was called Dynix/ptx.  In reality,
Dynix/ptx was still based on BSD, with some System V interface wrappers so it
could claim System V compatability, and an AT&amp;T license because the
USL vs Berkeley lawsuit hadn't been resolved in Berkeley's favor yet.

development center in the continental US is the Linux Technology
Center in Austin, Texas.  SCO's corporate headquarters during the
Monterey project (the period of the disputed contract) was in
California, with a large developer concentration in Canada.  Since the
&quot;events giving rise to the claims alleged herein&quot; occurred largely in
the fevered imagination of various SCO executives and nowhere else, a
case could be made that that they took place in Utah.  The reality is
that Utah is the venue only because SCO wanted a hometown advantage,
and it's dishonest to claim otherwise.  (This is a trivial error in
comparison to those in the rest of their complaint.)</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2790127"></a>Background Facts</h2></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2790134"></a>The UNIX Operating System</h3></div></div><p class="complaint">18.

combined total of 78 percent of the Unix market's revenue and leaving
SCO/Tarantella part of a long list of financial also-rans.  SCO's
market share came by pricing their systems so low they wound up in
financial difficulty and sold their Unix business to Caldera, to
finance a transition to something they considered potentially more
profitable.</p><p class="comment">To answer the question of exactly how widely SCO's own
Unix products are used, it's necessary to point out that SCO sells two very
different versions of Unix.  SCO OpenServer is a low-end product that traces
its heritage back to Microsoft Xenix in 1979.  OpenServer is primarily used
for point of sale systems such as fast food cash registers.  SCO's other
Unix line is UnixWare, which was named after Novell NetWare and is the
Unix product SCO acquired from Novell in 1995.  SCO put three years of
intense development effort into UnixWare between 1995 and 1998 in an
attempt to make an enterprise operating system out of it, but never
managed to achieve any significant marketshare or market
interest.</p><p class="comment">SCO's low-end product, OpenServer, provides the
majority of their product revenue and the vast majority of their unit
volume.  According to page 22 of <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102542/000110465903012299/j2045_10q.htm" target="_top">SCO's

player not only because their entire quarterly revenue from their

built by Dennis Ritchie, Ken Thompson and other software engineers at
AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories.  After successful in-house use of the UNIX

use in enterprise applications by other large companies.</p><p class="comment">This paragraph ignores huge contributions by
many developers outside of AT&amp;T, many of whom are active in the
Linux community today.  Specifically, at the time Unix was invented at

decree</a><sup>[<a name="id2852954" href="#ftn.id2852954">3</a>]</sup>.  Specifically, &quot;An injunction was
issued which barred AT&amp;T from engaging in any business other than
the provision of common carrier communication services, and required
Western Electric and AT&amp;T to license their patents to anyone who
wanted them upon the payment of appropriate royalties.&quot;
</p><p class="comment">Since AT&amp;T was forbidden from entering the computer
business, they could not sell Unix as a product.  The outside world found
out about Unix after Ken and Dennis presented a paper on their Unix research
at a 1973 ACM operating systems conference, and the paper was widely published
to the academic community in the proceedings of that conference in 1974.
The 1956 consent decree required AT&amp;T to license its technology to
outsiders who asked, but their offical policy concerning these academic
Unix licensees was:
<a href="http://www.linuxgazette.com/issue21/impress.html" target="_top">&quot;No advertising,
no support, no bug fixes, payment in advance.&quot;</a></p><p class="comment">Unix could not become a commercial product of
AT&amp;T before the 1984 divestiture undid the 1956 antitrust

decade-long gap, there was no commercial incentive for AT&amp;T to
invest in Unix development, but significant incentive for early
open-source development to occur, largely co-ordinated by the
University of California at Berkeley after Ken Thompson's teaching

I have to admit, it was fairly difficult to work with AT&amp;T back then. They simply didn't understand what they had. They didn't understand how to manage the asset, either in terms of promoting it properly or in terms of making sure that there wasn't fragmentation in how different implementations were put together. And so that vacuum in leadership created a bit of a dilemma for everybody who was involved in Unix.
</p><p class="comment">
Well, Microsoft stepped back and looked at that situation and said that the best thing for us might be to start from scratch: build a new system, focus on having a lot of the great things about Unix, a lot of the great things about Windows, and also being a file-sharing server that would have the same kind of performance that, up until that point, had been unique to Novell's Netware. 
</p><p class="comment">
And through Windows NT, you can see it throughout the design. In a weak sense, it is a form of Unix. There are so many of the design decisions that have been influenced by that environment. And that's no accident. I mean, we knew that Unix operability would be very important and we knew that the largest body of programmers that we'd want to draw on in building Windows NT applications would certainly come from the Unix base.

In the late 1980s, IBM also offered another version of Unix as an

not all) modern Unixes derive methods and ideas from System V.  But
the 1993 settlement, which forbade Novell and all their successors in

development, like SunOS, which either predated System V or were based
on BSD.  The claim in paragraph 28 is simply false.  It is factually
untrue.  Sun was quite profitably selling SunOS from its founding
until AT&amp;T purchased a significant equity stake in the company to
convince it to change horses.  IBM could easily have made a commercial
success of AOS.  The Santa Cruz Operation's founding in 1979, and
the early history of its core product OpenServer/Xenix, predates the
AT&amp;T divestiture and corresponding release of System V as the
first commercial software product from AT&amp;T.  Again, SCO wilfully
ignores the impact of a decade of Berkeley led open-source development
of BSD, because the truth undermines their case.</p><p class="complaint">29.  SCO is the sole and exclusive owner of all
Software and Sublicensing Agreements that control use, distribution

documentation and peripheral code and systems related thereto.</p><p class="comment">Both these claims are materially false 
for reasons already adduced, although this is the first time they
mention copyright.  Again, they are attempting to confuse issues; they
are not actually making copyright claims.</p><p class="comment">The copyrights to System V may also have been
impaired by the BSD lawsuit, the issue was left unresolved and would
have to be reopened if System V copyright claims were to be pressed.
AT&amp;T included code from BSD, SunOS, Xenix, and possibly other
sources in System V, but did not always get proper permission, and
even stripped off third-party copyright notices from the code it
incorporated.  It assumed that its ownership of Unix gave it carte
blanche ownership of derivative works, an assumption which came back to
haunt it during the BSD lawsuit.  The one thing SCO probably fears
most is a judge taking the 1993 settlement as a precedent.</p><p class="comment">In addition, Novell, the company that owned
System V before SCO/Tarantella, has stated claims that the copyrights
did not pass to SCO but remain with Novell.  SCO/Caldera claims to
have come up with an amendment to the contract between SCO/Tarantella
and Novell, which Novell itself cannot find a copy of in its files.
This issue remains unresolved, and Novell continues to strongly object
to SCO's complaints against IBM and the Linux community.</p><p class="comment">Even if SCO/Caldera's amendment proves to be
genuine, SCO had not registered a transfer of copyright with the
Patent and Trademark office at the time of the alleged contract
violation, or even at the time of filing its first complaint against
IBM in Utah court.  As such, any damages SCO could potentially be
awarded against IBM for violation of those unregistered copyrights are
capped by statute at $150,000 per infringing work.  Considering that
Microsoft has already given SCO several million dollars to pursue the
lawsuit against IBM and Linux, and they've already spent around two
million dollars on legal fees, copyright damages are not
significant.</p><p class="complaint">30.  During the 1990s the enterprise computing

is provided in <a href="#moores_law" title="C. Moore's Law">Appendix C</a>.</p><p class="complaint">36.  SCO's early engineers faced difficult
design challenges in modifying UNIX for effective use on an Intel
processing platform.  The principal design constraint centered around
the limited processing power the Intel chip possessed in the early
1980's.  The Intel chip (designed as it was for personal
computers) was not nearly as powerful as the enterprise chips used by
IBM, Sun, SGI and others in their respective UNIX offerings.</p><p class="comment">They admit that the early 16-bit Intel chips
which Microsoft comissioned Xenix for more than 20 years ago were of
&quot;limited processing power&quot;.  The Xenix system tailored to them was
also, unsurprisingly, of &quot;limited processing power&quot;.</p><p class="comment">Only the high price of memory kept Intel chips
competitive for mainstream PC users in the 1980s.  Since a single
megabyte of memory cost over $5000 when the IBM PC was introduced (see
the premier issue of PC Magazine, February 1982); a few hundred
dollars for the processor was irrelevant at that point.  A 32-bit
processor's ability to deal with much larger amounts of memory could
not be brought to bear until the price of memory came down (by which
point Intel had added 32-bit processors to its line and most Unix
vendors had begun experimenting with RISC processor designs).
However, followers of Moore's Law knew that 32-bit capability would be
necessary in future (due to memory prices dropping 50% every 18
months), which is why serious Unix vendors didn't want to waste time
on 16-bit platforms.  In the early 1980s, Moore's Law was actually an
argument _against_ 16-bit Intel processors.</p><p class="complaint">37.  Based on the early design constraint of
Intel's limited processing power, SCO found an appropriate
enterprise market niche for the early versions of SCO
OpenServer&#8212;single-purpose applications such as point-of-sale
control, inventory control and transactions processing, with the
highest possible reliability.  Intel processors were fully capable of
performing these relatively simple, repetitive tasks, and could do so
at a lower cost and as reliably as the more powerful enterprise
processing platforms sold by the other UNIX vendors, such as Sun and
IBM.</p><p class="comment">The PC's default operating system, DOS, could
run any of the &quot;single purpose applications&quot; they list, and it doesn't
even multitask.  Xenix's selling point was &quot;lower cost&quot; than other
Unix systems, especially the ability to squeeze into a tiny amount of
expensive memory.  SCO seems to think &quot;enterprise&quot; is synonymous with
&quot;cheap, low-end market niche&quot;.  They're proud their OS was capable of
performing simple, repetitive tasks at a lower cost than Sun and IBM.
To them, this means enterprise.</p><p class="complaint">38.  One example of a customer well suited to
the earlier version of SCO OpenServer software is McDonald's
Corp.  McDonald's has thousands of stores worldwide and needs all
stores to operate on an integrated computing platform for ease of use,
immediate access to information and uniformity.  However, the actual
computing requirements for each individual McDonald's location
are functionally simple&#8212;sales need to be tracked and recorded,
and inventory functions need to be linked to sales.  SCO OpenServer
reliably fulfills McDonald's computing requirements at reduced
cost.</p><p class="comment">Again, SCO considers running McDonald's cash
registers to be &quot;an appropriate enterprise market niche&quot;.  This is a
task which any modern laptop computer could run in the background
without the user at the keyboard noticing.  A battery-powered portable
CD player has enough computing ability to run a McDonald's cash
register.  Either they're intentionally lying, or they honestly don't
know what &quot;enterprise&quot; means in the operating systems market.</p><p class="comment"> Numerous DOS-based point of sale systems are

it meaningless.</p><p class="complaint">39.  SCO's business model for SCO
OpenServer provides enterprise customers the reliability,
extensibility (ease of adding or changing functionality), scalability
(ease of adding processors or servers to increase processing power)

Williams Company behind the product &#8220;Coherent&#8221;, is a good
sampling of what the PC Unix community understood eight years ago.
The users discussing the issue knew exactly why Coherent went under.
Already, Linux was a worthy substitute for traditional PC Unix
systems, and the Unix clone market was seen as shrinking due to it.
The rationale behind open-source development was already fairly
mature, as expressed <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=1995Feb5.223705.18369%40snugbug.cts.com" target="_top">in

got rid of it because they could not make money from it.  Novell
chose to exit the Unix market in 1995.  SCO chose to exit the Unix

executable format to allow the same programs to run without

of the group took place at SCO's corporate headquarters, on August 22,
1997.  Shortly thereafter, a SCO developer named Michael Davidson
wrote the utility <a href="http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~steven/lxrun/" target="_top">lxrun</a>, which
allowed Linux utilities to run on OpenServer and UnixWare.  Davidson
made lxrun an open-source project, which allowed <a href="http://wwws.sun.com/software/linux/compatibility/lxrun/" target="_top">Sun to

</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="comment">
&quot;So far as we've seen it's actually helped us,&quot; said Greg Schwarzer, director of small and medium business marketing at SCO. &quot;Linux has got the word out that Unix on Intel is a viable alternative to Microsoft.&quot;...

Linux, meanwhile, has reinvigorated the Unix market, he said. &quot;It has given a fresh, revitalized look to what people could do in the Intel space. Linux is a Unix movement. Revenues are going up strongly,&quot; Schwarzer said.

libraries, but do not seem to allege that these libraries are either
distributed with Linux systems or commonly pirated; nor is there any
claim that IBM has misappropriated them.  Their main complaint seems to
be that nobody wants to buy their SCO emulation module, ergo it must
be widely pirated.</p><p class="complaint">44.  Much of the functionality of an operating
system is made available to application developers by means of
&#8220;libraries&#8221; of code that are supplied by the operating
system vendor. These libraries contain many &#8220;functions&#8221;
or &#8220;routines&#8221; which can be used by application developers
to perform various common tasks such as reading or writing a file or
opening a new window on the screen.</p><p class="complaint">45.  SCO OpenServer, as with many other
operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, makes use of a special
kind of library called a &#8220;shared library.&#8221; The code for
all of the routines in a particular shared library is stored in a
separate file, and this code is loaded into memory &#8220;on
demand&#8221; when an application needs to make use of it.  There are
several benefits that come from using &#8220;shared libraries&#8221;
- applications can be smaller and use less memory because a single
copy of the library code is &#8220;shared&#8221; by all of the
applications that make use of it, and system vendors can easily update
the library code in order to fix problems or provide enhanced
functionality.  A side effect of this is that it is also very easy to
make a copy of a shared library.</p><p class="complaint">46.  In creating the thousands of SCO
OpenServer Applications, each designed for a specialized function in a
vertical industry, software developers wrote software code which
specifically made use of the SCO OpenServer shared libraries
(hereinafter the &#8220;SCO OpenServer Shared Libraries&#8221;), and
thus the presence of the SCO OpenServer Shared Libraries on a
particular system is required in order for these applications to be
able to run and function correctly.</p><p class="comment">Without application programs that give an operating
system something to do, there's not much point to having most computers
even switched on.  Third parties wrote a lot of valuable applications, and
years ago before Linux rose to prominence and back when the status of BSD was
still legally uncertain, they deployed a lot of them on systems like Xenix
(which became SCO OpenServer).</p><p class="comment">When a third party's source code was compiled to create
binary executable files to run on a SCO platform, those binaries would try
to load SCO's shared libraries to access standard operating system functions.
When compiled on another platform (like BSD or Linux), those binaries would
instead expect to link up with the BSD or Linux shared libraries.  (Versions
could even be compiled for other operating systems that had a Unix
compatability layer, such as the EMX package for OS/2 or the Cygwin package
for Windows.  In this case, the resulting binary file would depend on the shared
libraries of the appropriate Unix emulation package.)  This is
an incidental dependency, not inherent in the third party software but
simply an artifact of creating binary executable files intended to run on a
specific platform.</p><p class="complaint">47.  Linux offers a &#8220;SCO emulation
module,&#8221; originally called &#8220;iBCS&#8221; and now known as
&#8220;linux-abi&#8221; which enables applications which were
originally developed to run on SCO OpenServer to be run on Linux.
However, in order for these applications to function, the SCO
OpenServer Shared Libraries must also be copied onto the Linux system.
The SCO OpenServer Shared Libraries are the proprietary and
confidential property of SCO.  SCO OpenServer has been licensed to
numerous customers subject to restrictions on use that prohibit
unauthorized use of any of its software code, including without
limitation, the SCO OpenServer Shared Libraries.  SCO does not give
permission for copying of the Shared Libraries for use outside
OpenServer without payment of separate licensing fees.</p><p class="comment">IBCS stands for the &quot;Intel Binary Compatibility
Standard&quot;.  It was yet another attempt (like 86open and other efforts)
to unify the fragmented and incompatible Unix-on-x86 market.  Intel
pushed the standard in the early 1990s and it's been dead for so long
that most references to it have fallen off the web.  You can still
<a href="http://www.purplet.demon.co.uk/linux/ibcs/" target="_top">find a FAQ about
it</a>, and an <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/linux/shopper/141.html" target="_top">article
from 1999</a> described it as follows:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="comment">During the late
1980s/early 1990s Intel promoted a standard binary format for UNIX
executables, known as iBCS2 (Intel Binary Compatubility Standard
2). Linux has a kernel module available which provides support for all
the various derivatives of iBCS2, so that binaries compiled for a
whole range of older UNIXes can run: these include i386 BSD (386BSD,
FreeBSD, NetBSD, BSDI/386), SVR4 (Interactive, Unixware, USL, Dell.),
generic SVR3, SCO 3.2.x (COFF), SCO OpenServer 5 COFF and ELF
binaries, Wyse V/386 (SVR3 with extensions), Xenix V/386, and Xenix
V/286. This means that the odds are if you have an existing PC-based
UNIX system running some important software (say, an arcane stock
management system that isn't supported any more) you may well be able
to get it to run under Linux.</p></blockquote></div><p class="comment">Because SCO/Tarantella <a href="http://ou800doc.caldera.com/DIFFS/Standards_Gemini.html" target="_top">supported
iBCS</a> in UnixWare, it was sometimes possible to run UnixWare
applications under other Intel Unix versions, such as Linux, using an iBCS
support package for the platform.  This would be the only reason to
install SCO shared libraries on a Linux platform ala paragraph 46, and in some
cases that still wasn't necessary.  Linux did have its own shared libraries,
and since SCO was presumably providing a standard POSIX/SUS Unix API, in
theory adapting them shouldn't be too difficult.  In practice, the debugging
work required generally wasn't worth the effort, since these deployments were
normally aids to migration (to be used only until a native Linux version of the
application became available) rather than a permanent solution.</p><p class="comment">The reason iBCS for Linux has fallen out of use
is that it was mainly used to run a small number of proprietary
applications that have since released native Linux versions, such as Netscape
(which elevated Linux to Tier 1 platform status around the time it, <a href="http://wp.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease558.html" target="_top">announced
its intention to release source code</a> in 1998), and SAS (which
<a href="http://www.sas.com/presscenter/bgndr_history.html" target="_top">ported
its software to Linux in 2000</a>).  The main iBCS application
that Linux users wanted to run, by a wide margin, was Oracle's
database product, and when Oracle <a href="http://lwn.net/1999/features/1998timeline/" target="_top">announced support for
Linux in July 1998</a>, iBCS rapidly became irrelevant.  In the past
5 years, far more new proprietary packages have been released for Linux
than for both of SCO's proprietary Unix platforms combined.</p><p class="comment">Oracle's announcement of Linux support came the
same month Linux creator Linus Torvalds was on the cover of Forbes.
As the leading database vendor, Oracle's announcement prompted IBM to
announce a Linux version of its own database, DB2, two months later.
That announcement was IBM's first official acknowledgement of or
support for Linux at the corporate level<sup>[<a name="id2855010" href="#ftn.id2855010">8</a>]</sup>, and it was a reactive rather than proactive
measure.</p><p class="comment">In 2003, SCO no longer has interesting
applications that Linux lacks.  Since at least 1998, before IBM
first became even peripherally involved with Linux, major software
development houses have shipped Linux versions of their software,
often instead of SCO versions.  SCO has responded by creating
technologies like lxrun, and the Linux Kernel Personality for
UnixWare, to run Linux applications on SCO's operating system.
SCO/Tarantella realised this was a losing strategy and got out of the
proprietary Unix business in 2000.</p><p class="comment">Recently, SCO resurrected the issue of iBCS
support as part of its <a href="http://www.caldera.com/scosource/SCOsource_Presentation.ppt" target="_top">&quot;System
V for Linux&quot;</a> product, the first deliverable of the SCOsource
initiative, which is the newly launched division of SCO that is
driving the lawsuit against IBM.  The presentation describes System V
for Linux as &quot;SCO's Shared UNIX Libraries from OpenServer and UnixWare
for use with Linux&quot;, and claims that two answers to the question &quot;Why
License SCO's Intellectual Property&quot; are &quot;Strengthen Linux by
licensing value-add IP&quot; and &quot;Increase UNIX application use on Linux&quot;.
It also claims:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="comment">In the late 1980s, SCO created an open
specification called ibcs2 (Intel Binary Compatibility Standard) to
allow UNIX applications to run on Intel standard hardware using SCO's

Linux community was able to freely copy this and rename it Linux ABI
or Linux Application Binary Interface.</p><p class="comment">In order to run UNIX apps on Linux, customers
must have Linux ABI and SCO's shared libraries.</p><p class="comment">SCO's shared libraries could never be licensed
outside of the SCO operating systems until today.</p></blockquote></div><p class="comment">The third paragraph of that is wrong: in order to

SCO's shared libraries would be of no use whatsoever.</p><p class="comment">It's interesting to note that they claim to have
invented the Intel Binary Compatibility Standard, rather than Intel.
Also, the most recent document they can find explaining how to run a
SCO binary on Linux explains how to run WordPerfect 5, from 1995.

also references
the retention of Boies, Schiller and Flexner by SCOsource (the lawfirm
retained to persue the current suit against IBM) while at the same
time it hawks a Linux product.  Apparently, this attempt to profit from
Linux and the IBM lawsuit were launched more or less simultaneously.</p><p class="comment">SCO points out that System V for Linux
is the first time they've licensed their shared libraries seperately
from their operating system, but skips over the fact that people who
legally owned a copy of a SCO operating system but chose to migrate to Linux
could legally use those shared libraries under Linux, because they do have
a license to own them and copyright law cannot pevent the re-use under the
&#8220;first sale&#8221; doctrine.  (It could also be considered an example
of &quot;space shifting&quot;.)  The only users likely to have a significant number of
legacy SCO applications they'd want to run on a new platform are users who
migrated from a SCO platform to Linux, and thus have a SCO license they
are otherwise no longer using.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2855263"></a>SCO's Development of UnixWare on Intel</h3></div></div><p class="complaint">48.  While the original SCO OpenServer operating system performs

it.</p><p class="comment">SCO/Tarantella had noticed Linux as early as
1995, when Linux put Coherent out of business.  In 1998 its responses
to Linux included iBCS, lxrun, and the 86open project.  It also
stepped up its &quot;skunkware&quot; project, to collect and distribute open
source for SCO platforms (even shipping skunkware CD's with SCO's
operating system).  SCO's &quot;Open Source Program Architect&quot;, Ronald Joe
Record, gave <a href="ftp://ftp2.caldera.com/pub/skunkware/intro/index.html" target="_top">a very
interesting slide presentation about SCO's open-source efforts</a>
at SCO Forum 98.  Major releases of SCO Skunkware were made in 1998,
1996, and earlier.</p><p class="comment">SCO/Tarantella's co-founding of the Monterey
project in October 1998 was a second attempt to make their proprietary
Unix technology relevant to enterprise customers.  If their own
in-house efforts had succeeded, they would not have needed to partner
with IBM, Sequent, and others.</p><p class="comment">The three years of development work in
pargraphs 51-52 have no bearing on the historical System V code other
vendors had already licensed and upgraded on their own in the 1980s and
early 90s.  Any development work done by SCO in 1995 would merely create yet
another derivative work, in this case UnixWare 7.</p><p class="complaint">53.  SCO was ready to offer large enterprise
customers a high-end UNIX computing platform based on inexpensive
Intel processors.  Given the rapid growth of Intel's performance
capabilities and Intel's popularity in the marketplace, SCO found
itself in a highly desirable market position.  In addition, SCO still
had its SCO OpenServer business for retail and inventory-targeted
functions, with its 4,000 applications in support.</p><p class="complaint">54.  Prior to the events complained of in this
action, SCO was the <span class="highlight">undisputed global leader in the

processing platforms</span>.</p><p class="comment">This statement is simply false.  See <a href="http://www.opensource.org/sco-vs-ibm.html#inflates" target="_top">the original
OSI position paper</a> for a detailed refutation.  By the end of
1998 SCO had added support to its products for the Intel Binary
Compatibility Standard (iCBS), participated in the 86open project, and
created lxrun.  None of these actions would have made sense for an
&#8220;undisputed leader&#8221;.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2855757"></a>Project Monterey</h3></div></div><p class="complaint">55.  As SCO was poised and ready to expand its
market and market share for UnixWare targeted to high-performance
enterprise customers, IBM approached SCO to jointly develop a 64-bit
UNIX-based operating system for a new 64-bit Intel platform.  This
joint development effort was widely known as Project Monterey.</p><p class="comment">The translation of &quot;poised and ready to expand&quot;
is something like &quot;scratching its head wondering why nothing had
happened&quot;.  SCO/Tarantella had never previously been in the same
league as Sun, HP, and IBM, and its development efforts did not
suddenly elevate it there.  Linux was already eating into proprietary
Unix vendors' marketshare on 32-bit x86 machines, prompting Sun to
give away free licenses to Solaris for x86.  And Linux itself was not
the only reason for the erosion of SCO's market; the success of Linux
and FreeBSD helped pave the way for Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/1998/may/11strategy.html" target="_top">may 1998
announcement</a> of a new OS development strategy, MacOS X based
on a combination of FreeBSD and Carnegie Mellon's <a href="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/mach/public/www/mach.html" target="_top">Mach
microkernel</a>.  (<a href="http://www.osnews.com/printer.php?news_id=3757" target="_top">Here's an article
on the convoluted history of MacOS X</a>).  Apple's move to Unix
also cut into the low and midrange Unix markets, SCO's bread and
butter.  Their attempted move to high end &quot;enterprise computing&quot; was
an exit strategy from their rapidly deteriorating existing
market.</p><p class="comment">SCO/Caldera seems to be attempting to imply that
project Monterey was some kind of bait distracting them at a crucial
moment, and that if it hadn't been for IBM, UnixWare would have
blossomed into a success.  The fact that UnixWare continued to be
developed and marketed during Monterey development and continued to be a dud
is a counter-argument.  SCO/Caldera joined Monterey because their own
in-house development efforts had not achieved significant enterprise
market share.  They wanted IBM's help.  They jumped at the chance to
get it.</p><p class="complaint">56.  Prior to this time, IBM had not developed
any expertise to run UNIX on an Intel processor and instead was
confined to its Power PC processor.</p><p class="comment">Paragraph 56 is completely wrong.  AIX for
PS/2 was announced at the PS/2 launch in 1987.  IBM also shipped AOS,
a BSD derivative, for PS/2 systems.  IBM's first Unix product for its
x86 PC shipped in 1983 (as described in the response to Paragraph 26).</p><p class="comment">In addition, the statement is intentionally misleading.
Although Itanium was from Intel, it was a very different design from
Intel's traditional x86 processor line.  Monterey was an effort to
port Unix to a completely new hardware architecture, a 64-bit
processor with a new instruction set (based on VLIW design principles
which, like RISC, IBM had invented years before).  Itanium (originally
code-named Merced) was jointly designed by Intel and HP.  Writing code
for the 64-bit Itanium processor has more similarity with writing code
for 64-bit RISC Power PC processors than writing for 32-bit CISC x86
processors.</p><p class="comment">Monterey was not the first such 64-bit processor
either.  The first 64-bit RISC processor, the DEC Alpha (now owned by
HP due to its purchase of Compaq, which had previously purchased DEC)
was <a href="http://sect18020.www1.hp.com/newsroom/presspaq/062501/FactSheet.html" target="_top">introduced
in February 1992</a>.  The first 64 bit Unix for this processor,
DEC OSF/1 (later renamed Tru64 Unix) was introduced in March 1993.  It
had nothing to do with SCO.</p><p class="comment">The article <a href="http://www.rootvg.net/column_risc.htm" target="_top">27 years of IBM RISC</a>
points out that IBM's own internal development led to the release of a
64-bit PowerPC processor and a 64-bit version of AIX (4.3), in 1997.
The article says:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="comment">The RS64 (also known as Apache) is the

Enterprise Server model 7017-S70 (125 MHz, code named Raven), the
first 12-way SMP system, and AIX Version 4.3.</p></blockquote></div><p class="comment">IBM had more experience with 64-bit computing
than SCO did, having designed and marketed its own 64-bit processor
and a version of AIX that could run 64-bit applications.</p><p class="complaint">57.  SCO, on the other hand, had over 15 years
of expertise in adapting UNIX to Intel based systems.  Moreover, SCO
had spent the previous 18 months working closely with Intel to adapt
its existing UnixWare product to work on the new 64-bit Intel
processor. That project, known as &quot;Gemini-64,&quot; was well underway when
work on Project Monterey was started.  In furtherance of, and in
reliance on, IBM's commitment to Project Monterey, SCO ceased
work on the Gemini-64 Project and expended substantial amounts of
money and dedicated a significant portion of SCO's development team to
Project Monterey.  Specifically, plaintiff and plaintiff's
predecessor provided IBM engineers with valuable information and trade
secrets with respect to architecture, schematics, and design of
UnixWare and the UNIX source code for both 32- and 64-bit Intel-based
processors.</p><p class="comment">Over 15 years ago SCO was adapting Xenix to the
16-bit 8086 and 286 processors in the original IBM PC and AT lines,
which were less powerful than a modern cell phone.  This has no
relevance whatsoever to modern &quot;enterprise&quot; systems.  The first 32 bit
processor in the x86 line, the 386, supported over a dozen Unix ports,
including AIX for the PS/2 from IBM.</p><p class="comment">SCO is trying to confuse &quot;Gemini 64&quot; with the
three years of development they mentioned in pargraphs 51-52.  The
purpose of the development in pargraphs 51-52 was to turn UnixWare 2,
which SCO/Tarantella purchased from Novell in 1995, into UnixWare 7,
released in 1998. This development resulted in a product release for
32-bit x86 Intel processors (the 386, 486, and Pentium lines).</p><p class="comment">The Gemini-64 project was an experimental
effort at SCO to play around with Intel's unfinished 64-bit design
(code named &quot;Merced&quot;, and released as &quot;Itanium&quot;), which could only be
tested on emulators since Intel hadn't manufactured any actual 64-bit
processor chips yet.  SCO eventually admitted they were in over their
heads, canned Gemini-64, and sent the Gemini engineers off to work with IBM.
</p><p class="comment">By the way, does SCO really claim to have trade secrets
related to the architecture and schematics of Intel's new hardware design?
(Wouldn't these be Intel's trade secrets, which IBM could get from Intel?
If IBM could NOT get them directly from Intel, wouldn't SCO be violating its
agreements with Intel in passing them on?)  The most charitable
reading is that SCO is trying to inflate its importance, or simply
confusing two issues again.</p><p class="complaint">58.  By about May 2001, all technical aspects
of Project Monterey had been substantially completed.  The only
remaining tasks of Project Monterey involved marketing and branding
tasks to be performed substantially by IBM.</p><p class="comment">Except that market interest in Monterey never
materialized, in large part because the Itanium hardware was a flop,
completely unsuccessful in the mainstream computer market.  To read the gory
details of the Itanium disaster, see <a href="#itanium" title="D. The Itanic Disaster">Appendix D</a> at the end of
this document.</p><p class="comment">Beyond that, the initial point of the Monterey
project was another standardization effort, like the <a href="http://www.netfact.com/crs/papers/talks/osf/osf.doc" target="_top">Open
Software Foundation</a> of the late 1980s.  Periodically, when
the proprietary Unix market gets too fragmented, a group of vendors
band together for a while, and after a while collapse into bickering
and pointless infighting.  The Open Software Foundation was originally
a joint effort between leading Unix vendors including IBM, Hewlett
Packard, and Digital Equipment Corporation (now part of HP, via
Compaq), in reaction to AT&amp;T's purchase of an equity stake in Unix
vendor Sun Microsystems.  (Everybody but Sun and AT&amp;T formed an
opposing camp.)  OSF eventually collapsed, and their operating systems
release (OSF/1) became Tru64 Unix, a product for the DEC Alpha
processor.  Other theoretically similar standardization efforts
predating Monterey include Unix International, and the groups behind
Posix and the Single Unix Specification.  (The second edition of the
book &quot;Life with Unix&quot; talks about all this in detail.)</p><p class="comment">Monterey was another such standardization effort,
as explained in <a href="#itanium" title="D. The Itanic Disaster">Appendix D</a>.</p><p class="complaint">59.  On or about May 2001, IBM notified
plaintiff that it refused to proceed with Project Monterey, and that
IBM considered Project Monterey to be &#8220;dead.&#8221;</p><p class="comment">For entirely justifiable business reasons.  The Itanium
was a disaster, IBM had purchased Sequent for its NUMA technology, and Linux
had gone mainstream around 1998.  Project Monterey was an obvious

distributor Caldera purchased SCO was not to get its technology, but to get
an international distribution channel through which to sell Linux.  (The

have been another hint about what part of the deal excited them.)</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2856212"></a>The AT&amp;T UNIX Agreements</h3></div></div><p class="complaint">60.  AT&amp;T Technologies originally licensed

marketplace is largely a function of its reliability, extensibility,
and robust performance capability.  That is to say, it virtually never
needs repair, it performs well under a wide variety of adverse
circumstances, and it can be extended throughout an enterprise and
across multiple processors to perform unified or disparate tasks in a
seamless computing environment.  Because of these features, UNIX-based
equipment has replaced mainframe computers for all but the most
demanding computing tasks.  And, because UNIX-based equipment is far
cheaper than mainframe computing equipment, a customer who cannot
otherwise justify the cost of mainframe computers can otherwise gain
the advantages of &#8220;supercomputing&#8221; operations through use
of UNIX-based equipment.</p><p class="comment">Linux systems have been replacing other Unix systems
since before the Mark Williams Company went out of business in 1995.</p><p class="comment">A representative story is how, in 1996, <a href="http://archive.infoworld.com/articles/hn/xml/00/01/31/000131hnlinux.xml" target="_top">Cisco
replaced its Solaris-based print servers with Linux systems</a>.
Originally the printing system, which handled invoices, customer
orders, manufacturing documents, and other tasks without which the
company could not even temporarily function, was considered too
important to trust to Linux.  But Cisco was growing faster than
Solaris servers could be installed (factoring in budget approvals,
purchase orders, and shipping).  A few Linux servers were installed to
handle the overflow, since a Linux system could be assembled and
installed out of spare PC parts and downloaded software in a few
hours.  But after a 1997 power failure, the Solaris servers did not
come back online (requiring manual maintenance to repair after being
improperly shut down), and the Linux servers all came back online as
soon as the power was restored, and handled Cisco's entire printing
needs while the Solaris machines were out of commission.  After Linux
proved itself in this crisis, Cisco switched entirely over to Linux
for its mission-critical print system and retired the Sun print
servers on <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=2907" target="_top">August 1,

if SCO/Caldera means SMP support, it should remember that Caldera <a href="http://www.linux.org.uk/SMP/title.html" target="_top">proudly sponsored</a> the

of the Linux kernel was released <a href="http://ftp.cdut.edu.cn/pub2/linux/kernel/history/1996.html" target="_top">June, 1996</a>.)  SCO still has
<a href="http://www.caldera.com/developers/community/contrib/linux.html" target="_top">a web
page bragging about their contributions to the Linux kernel</a>.</p><p class="comment">If, on the other hand, extending across multiple
processors means that the same operating system not only runs on x86
processors, but is also available for Sun's Sparc, IBM's Power PC and
S/390 mainframes, The Alpha and HP-PA processors owned by Hewlett

improving SMP support for Linux, which they used extensively.  By mid
1997, Linus was working exclusively on SMP machines, as noted in

Truly cheap commodity SMP systems became available retail with the

technologically feasible or even possible at the enterprise level without (a) a
high degree of design coordination, (b) access to expensive and
sophisticated design and testing equipment; (c) access to UNIX code

very significant financial investment.</p><p class="comment">In the highlighted phrase, SCO complains that the Linux
community only took about nine years to get really world-class SMP support
(1991-2000), where it took SCO's predecessors twenty (presumably 1969-1989).
It seems like SCO is simply complaining &quot;We're slow, those Linux guys shouldn't
code so fast&quot;, but actually there's more to it.</p><p class="comment">First off, AT&amp;T's original Unix started out as the pet
project of a group of researchers on obsolete, underpowered, secondhand
hardware.  It was then adapted to single-processor DEC minicomputers (the
PDP-11 and VAX lines), which were not SMP capable (a single VAX processor was
the size of a refrigerator).  Unix was not even widely used as a 32-bit system
until the 1980's (and that was thanks to BSD's VAX version, funded by the
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, a federal program which also
sponsored the early internet).</p><p class="comment">Beyond that, AT&amp;T was not a computer company; it
bought computers from other companies, and it did so on a budget.  Unix was
used on minicomputers (not mainframes) for its first ten to fifteen years,
because mainframes were too expensive to trust to an unusual new operating
system.  Up in the mainframe world, IBM had its own SMP systems long before it
became involved in Unix, and  Sequent developed its first NUMA multi-processor
system (running BSD) in 1983, only 10 years after Unix was first released
outside of Bell Labs.</p><p class="comment">In 1983, SCO was selling a stripped down version of Unix
to run in a 16-bit processor that could access only 1 megabyte of RAM, and
booting from floppies because the original IBM PC had no hard drive.  None of
Intel's x86 processors before the Pentium had any support for multi-processor
operation.  The Intel Multi-Processor Specification saying how to do it only
came out in 1994<sup>[<a name="id2858634" href="#ftn.id2858634">12</a>]</sup>; the few PC SMP systems before that
were improvised, nonstandard, unreliable, and extremely expensive.
Multi-processor PC hardware has only became cheap and widely available since
2000, with dual Athlon motherboards and the Hyper-Threading features of the
Pentium 4.</p><p class="comment">The main reason it took Linux as long as it did to support

of Linux SMP support had surpassed most commercial offerings.</p><p class="comment">But SMP is just one example of a larger problem.  SCO
doesn't know what's necessary to design enterprise functionality because
they've never done it.  So let's go over the points one letter at a time.</p><p class="comment">A) the Linux community has a high degree of
design coordination through the internet: the linux developers are in
constant communication with each other through the linux-kernel
mailing list, as well as IRC and in-person meetings at venues like the
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/3327/" target="_top">Linux Kernel Summit</a>
at the annual <a href="http://www.linuxsymposium.org" target="_top">Ottawa Linux
Symposium</a>.</p><p class="comment">B) The only design and testing equipment the
linux kernel developers need is the hardware the systems will run on.
They are developing software, and the tools they do it with are also
software: compilers, debuggers, profilers...  all software.  (There
are web pages for <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/gdb/" target="_top">gdb</a>, <a href="http://oss.sgi.com/projects/kdb/" target="_top">kdb</a>, <a href="http://developer.kde.org/~sewardj/" target="_top">valgrind</a>, <a href="http://metacomp.stanford.edu/" target="_top">the Stanford Checker</a>, and

talk recently</a> of adding debugging markers to the Linux kernel
itself, but they have so far proven unnecessary.)</p><p class="comment">C) SCO is using the conclusion it wishes to reach as
an assertion, to support itself.  In reality, the Linux developers have
a multitude of published Unix standards, including Posix and the Single Unix
Specification.  A fully automated Posix Test
Suite <a href="http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0304.3/1526.html" target="_top">was
recently released</a>.</p><p class="comment">In terms of books, the Linux developers had
Maurice J. Bach's &quot;The Design of the Unix Operating System&quot;, the Minix book,
the BSD books and BSD code...  Linus Torvalds listed several of the books
he'd used in creating Linux back at the start of 1992, see

Unix applications which have been converted to run on Linux serve as the
real test harness.  If a program fails in a reproducible manner, it's
easy to find out why and correct the problem.  In the absence of a failing
program, technical differences between operating system implementations are
academic and irrelevant.</p><p class="comment">Linux also has tens of thousands of computer
science graduate students (like Linus was originally) who are young,
eager, energetic, and quite willing to reinvent the light bulb as a
learning experience.  This brings us to...</p><p class="comment">D) No experience necessary, they learn on the
job.  There are thousands of Unix programs available to test out on
the new system, and they can improve performance by studying
benchmarks.  The Mindcraft tests are <a href="http://www.linuxgazette.com/issue42/lg_answer42.html" target="_top">a good
example of this</a>, revealing the &quot;thundering herd&quot; problem.
(Something other operating systems had dealt with years earlier, but
this was the first time the Linux crowd noticed it.)  They
introduced wake-one semantics to deal with it, and moved on.  This
sort of thing happens every week, resulting in a steady increase in
performance and scalability.  <a href="http://www.kegel.com/mindcraft_redux.html" target="_top">Dan Kegel's Mindcraft
Redux page</a> provides a very detailed analysis of Linux
scalability improvements that have occurred since Microsoft hired
Mindcraft to discredit Linux.</p><p class="comment">E) If financial investment was all it took,
Microsoft Windows would be a technically superior product to any Unix.
The enormous proliferation of web pages in the early 1990s did not
require financial investment from any central organization owning the
internet.  Yahoo evolved out of a graduate project of two university
students.  The current search engine leader, Google, has been running
entirely on Linux systems from the start, and employs full-time
engineers who contribute improvements back to the Linux kernel because
a better Linux kernel helps them be a better search engine.  (You can
listen to recordings of two speeches from Jim Reese, Chief Operations
Engineer of Google: <a href="http://technetcast.ddj.com/tnc_play_stream.html?stream_id=420" target="_top">The
Technology Behind Google</a> and a related <a href="http://technetcast.ddj.com/tnc_play_stream.html?stream_id=421" target="_top">Question
and Answer session with Jim Reese</a>.)  Thousands of companies
contribute their improvements back to Linux for the simple reason that
it's too much work to maintain their own custom version, and much
cheaper and easier to simply have the fix included in the next release
of Red Hat or SuSE, and not have to worry about losing repairs when
you upgrade.</p><p class="comment">That said, IBM announced that starting in 2001
it would <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1001-249750.html" target="_top">spend
$1 billion a year</a> on new Linux development.  Spending money on
new development is not actually illegal, and for a company of IBM's

its money off of today, was a discontinued piece of trash in 1999 that
Caldera initially didn't want to buy.  The fact it's now the majority

of their business (including their Linux business) dried up and blew
away.</p><p class="comment">And if Caldera is claiming IBM illegally
enhanced Linux, yet Caldera can't make money off of Linux despite
having been a Linux vendor since 1994 and having released its
fastest-selling Linux product ever shortly before the SCO acqusition,
while other companies are still making billions off of Linux, then
that's even stronger evidence that Caldera's current management is

business model from products to services.</p><p class="comment">Actually, IBM was always a services company.  Back
during the Great Depression of the 1930's, IBM survived because it leased
out its tabulator machines instead of selling them, and thus had a steady
revenue stream when other companies were going belly-up.<sup>[<a name="id2859191" href="#ftn.id2859191">13</a>]</sup>
A pointy-haired CEO screwed this up in the 1980's (selling off the golden
goose for short-term gain by taking its customers off a rental model, and
booking huge revenues from one-time sales of the existing deployed equipment).
This resulted in the 1992 crash of IBM's stock (the loss of PC leadership
didn't help, but that wasn't what sucker-punched their bottom line), and Lou
Gerstner put it back on track again when he became CEO after the crash.</p><p class="comment">Following IBM's return to its service roots, SCO/Caldera
was also attempting to become a service company.  SCO still has a service
division, it just doesn't produce much revenue.  SCO/Caldera was unsuccessful
at pursuing a strategy IBM started first and executed better, and they're
trying to make it sound like IBM did something wrong.</p><p class="complaint">86.  In the process of moving from product
offerings to services offerings, IBM dramatically increased its staff
of systems integrators to 120,000 strong under the marketing brand
&#8220;IBM Global Services.&#8221; By contrast, IBM's largest
historic competitor as a seller of UNIX software, Sun Microsystems,
has a staff of approximately 12,000 systems integrators.  With ten
times more services-related personnel than its largest competitor, IBM
sought to move the corporate enterprise computing market to a services
model based on free software on Intel processors.</p><p class="comment">This paragraph is basically saying that IBM was much
bigger and much more successful than SCO.  Does this come as news to anybody?
</p><p class="comment">IBM acted intelligently.  The last major wave of
commoditization in a maturing computer market was the rise of commodity PCs.
IBM was on the wrong side of that one, trying to assemble commodity parts into
a proprietary product and losing control of the market to clones of its
own design.  It was a humiliating lesson which IBM hasn't forgotten.</p><p class="comment">This time, the now-mature software market is
commoditizing, and IBM wants to be on the winning side: providing
services, support, and integrated solutions within the level playing
field provided by the commodity market.</p><p class="comment">IBM decided to support Linux because it learned
the lesson of the PC.  When the market is ready to commoditize, don't
stand in its way.</p><p class="complaint">87.  By making the Linux operating system free
to end users, IBM could undermine and destroy the ability of any of
its competitors to charge a fee for distribution of UNIX software in
the enterprise market.  Thus, IBM, with its army of Global Services
integrators who earn money by selling services, would gain a
tremendous advantage over all its competitors who earn money by
selling UNIX licenses.</p><p class="comment">IBM didn't make the Linux operating system free
to end users.  The Linux operating system was already free to end
users.  Linux has always been a free product, since its inception.
You can't blame IBM for Linux being free!</p><p class="comment">That said, there's a business to be had shipping
boxed copies of Linux.  <a href="http://www.desktoplinux.com/articles/AT3224314245.html" target="_top">SCO's
current CEO, Darl McBride, liked to compare selling boxed copies of
Linux to selling bottled water.</a> Doing so used to be Caldera's
core business, and is still the core business of Red Hat and SuSE.
Caldera's Linux was <a href="http://www.caldera.com/company/press/rollsout.html" target="_top">a boxed
retail product in 1997</a>.  IBM's actions have not undermined Red
Hat or SuSE's profitability, they've enhanced them.  SCO's failure is
SCO's fault.</p><p class="comment">Taking a second look at paragraph 87: SCO isn't
actually claiming that IBM did anything illegal.  IBM commoditized
their co-factors to undercut the competition, and made a load of money
selling more support and services.  That's good business.  Caldera's
tried to do the same thing, that's why they have a services arm.
They're just not very good at it.</p><p class="complaint">88.  To accomplish the end of transforming the
enterprise software market to a services-driven market, IBM set about
to deliberately and improperly destroy the economic value of UNIX and
particularly the economic value of UNIX on Intel-based
processors.</p><p class="comment">Linux was already undercutting other Unix
vendors.  The first casualty was the Mark Williams Company (maker of
the PC Unix clone Coherent) which went out of business in 1995.  Consolidation

by the wayside.</p></blockquote></div><p class="comment">Many other industry observers made similar
predictions.</p><p class="complaint">89.  Among other actions, IBM misappropriated
the confidential and proprietary information from SCO in Project
Monterey.  IBM thereafter misused its access to the UNIX source
code.</p><p class="comment">This is SCO's core assertion.  This seems to
be the reason they're picking on IBM rather than on some other vendor
like HP or Sony.  It's buried in paragraph 89 because by itself, it
is weak and unsupportable.</p><p class="comment">The problems with SCO's core assertion include
that misappropriated technology was never necessary to make Linux a
success, IBM was only one of thousands of companies with access to
ancient System V code, and nobody in the industry cares about System V
anymore because it's obsolete rubbish, and SCO is accusing IBM of
doing things that SCO itself repeatedly announced plans to do.
Not to mention the fact that they have been unable to show any
misappropriated code snippets that survive scrutiny, and are reduced
to Joe &quot;witchhunt&quot; McCarthy's old technique of waving a piece of paper
and claiming it proves something without letting anybody else see it.</p><p class="complaint">90.  On or about August 17, 2000, IBM and Red

         The notion actually came through with Linux, which was open
         source and supported all hardware.  We continued with
         Monterey as an extension of AIX [IBM UNIX] to support
         high-end hardware.  AIX 5 has the best of Monterey.  Linux
         cannot fill that need today, but over time we believe it
         will.  To help out we're making contributions to the
         open source movement like the journal file system.  We
         can't tell our customers to wait for Linux to grow
         up.</p><p class="complaint">If Linux had all of the capabilities

         Linux, then we would.</p><p class="complaint">Right now the Linux kernel does not
         support all the capabilities of AIX.  We've been working
         on AIX for 20 years.  Linux is still young. We're
         helping Linux kernel up to that level.  We understand where
         the kernel is.  We have a lot of people working now as part
         of the kernel team.  At the end of the day, the customer
         makes the choice, whether we write for AIX or for
         Linux.</p><p class="complaint">We're willing to open source any
         part of AIX that the Linux community considers valuable.  We
         have open-sourced the journal file system, print driver for

         that on the open source community then are people going to
         understand it?  You're better off taking bits and pieces

his rationale</a>:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="comment">When a
company decides to release existing proprietary code as Open Source,
the show-stopper is almost always the other parties outside of that
company who are involved. Such parties become involved through patents
that have been licensed, proprietary code that has been produced by a
third party and embedded into the product, and existing contracts
relating to the product that have been entered into with customers or
other vendors. These sorts of factors complicate the release of every
piece of Open Source software I've consulted on at HP so far, no
matter what division it comes from.</p><p class="comment">So, if OpenMail is released as Open Source, we
will have to first sanitise it: remove software that is connected with
non-disclosure agreements that we entered, patents that we licensed,
proprietary code that we bought but can't relicense, and so on. And we
must make sure that the result doesn't bring us into violation of
contracts we made with customers and vendors, such as the agreements
we made with customers when they licensed the OpenMail product. We
don't know how big this sanitisation project is yet, if it's bad, it
could cost Millions.</p></blockquote></div><p class="comment">To any open-source developer, it is quite obvious
what IBM's Robert LeBlanc meant: the release of an audited, sanitized,
and probably heavily redacted version of AIX.  Even relatively small
proprietary projects, like the <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=5118" target="_top">open-source
release of Borland's Inprise database</a> require the codebase to
be extensively scrutinized to remove licensed third party intellectual
property.</p><p class="comment">No one would expect IBM's representative to try
to fit that obvious and expected detail in an interview sound bite,
and if he did the interviewer would probably trim it as superfluous legal
boilerplate.  Of COURSE IBM would audit the code first.  IBM is biologically
incapable of going to the bathroom without running the idea by its lawyers
first, and coming up with an <a href="http://www-1.ibm.com/servers/aix/products/aixos/certifications/" target="_top">ISO 9001</a> documented procedure, which it then
follows to the letter, because that's how it thinks.  We wouldn't expect
anything else.  (I'm almost certain IBM has documented intellectual
property auditing procedures that predate the first Unix prototype at
Bell Labs, let alone the founding of SCO/Tarantella.  And I suspect that its
modern ISO 9001 procedures for doing it are quite a bit longer.)</p><p class="complaint">92.  IBM, however, was not and is not in a
position legally to &#8220;open source any part of AIX that the Linux
community considers valuable.&#8221; Rather, IBM is obligated not to
open source AIX because it contains SCO's confidential and
proprietary UNIX source code, derivative works and methods.</p><p class="comment">The portions of AIX that contain Unix source
code that was not part of BSD or the open-sourced System III Unix
release would have to be removed.  But since the Berkeley developers
managed to do this, it was unlikely to be beyond IBM's abilities.</p><p class="comment">Also, given that the historical Unix code then
belonged to a Linux vendor (Caldera) which was making numerous
statements at the time about combining Linux and Unix, and releasing
Unix code under open-source licenses (which they did with System III
and earlier), IBM had every reason to believe that getting permission
to open-source any ancient 1980s source code contained in AIX would
be granted if IBM asked for it.  The only reason IBM did not ask is
because they <span class="emphasis"><em>didn't open-source AIX</em></span>.  They merely
stated that they, IBM, had no objection to doing so if the community
expressed interest, which the open-source community had not done and
still has not done.  That is why it never progressed far enough to
worry about permissions or intellectual property audit teams and
procedures.</p><p class="comment">As for SCO's interest in Monterey, if that was a
concern then a version of AIX released before the start of the
Monterey project could have been the basis for any hypothetical
release of AIX.  It never got as far as selecting a version, because
there was no release and no serious movement towards a release.</p><p class="complaint">93.  Over time, IBM made a very substantial
<span class="highlight">financial commitment to improperly put SCO's
confidential and proprietary information into Linux</span>,
the free operating system.  On or about May 21, 2001 IBM Vice President
Richard Michos, stated in an interview to Independent Newspapers, New Zealand,
inter alia:</p><p class="comment">If IBM had shown any interest in putting SCO's
proprietary information into Linux, it could have purchased SCO
outright when the stock was trading at under $1/share.  IBM doesn't
need a five year committment to spend a billion dollars per year to

per year on new Linux development.  (Why would misappropriating SCO
technology require IBM to spend money to do so?)</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="complaint">IBM will put US $1 billion this year
         into Linux, the free operating system.</p><p class="complaint">IBM wants to be part of the community

         works on improvements to the Linux kernel, or source code.
         This includes programmers who work in the company's
         Linux technology center, working on making the company's
         technology Linux-compatible.</p></blockquote></div><p class="complaint">That team of IBM programmers is improperly
extracting and using SCO's UNIX technology from the same building
that was previously the UNIX Technology Center.</p><p class="comment">If SCO is referring to <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/arl/images/gen/ibmaustin2.gif" target="_top">IBM's
&quot;900 block&quot; of research buildings in Austin, Texas</a>, they have
a number of uses.  The OS/2 development team which the lead author of this
document (Rob Landley) worked with years ago was in building 903, and
the AIX guys (who went on to do JavaOS development) were in building
901.  (The OS/2 developers and AIX developers did not speak to each
other outside of the cafeteria in building 908, and did not have
access to each other's codebases.)</p><p class="comment">I still have friends who work at IBM, and they
tell me that The Linux Technology Center is in the basement of
building 908.  (Go down the stairs in front of the cafeteria, and
instead of going into the library go through the other set of doors.)
The people I know who work there are ex-OS/2 developers, not AIX
developers.  (This could be one reason project Monterey and project
Trillian ran in parallel: they were two different departments under
two different management chains of command, in two different
buildings.  This sort of thing is common at IBM, it's a big company.)</p><p class="comment">The president of SCO/Tarantella understood this
when he stated <a href="http://www.vnunet.com/News/88805" target="_top">IBM's
participation in the Trillian project posed no threat to
Monterey</a> on August 20, 1999.  He explained:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="comment">&#8220;IBM has joined so many things over
the years, itâs not funny. I donât think itâs put a significant amount
of money into Trillian and itâs a small amount of money to be part of
a trend. Itâs important to look at internal sponsorship in
IBM. Monterey is supported by Bob Stevenson, whoâs head of IBMâs
server group and Lou Gerstner [IBMâs chief executive] has also bought
it off as a strategic initiative.&#8221;</p><p class="comment">He added: &#8220;IBM is not looking at Trillian as an
alternative to Monterey. The real interest in Linux is coming from all
the software companies that sell databases and transaction based tools
because they are frustrated that Microsoft more or less gives these
things away as part of the Back Office bundle. So they say âif you
give us a free OS, weâll make money from itâ.&#8221;</p></blockquote></div><p class="complaint">94.  In a news article issued by e-Business

         to use it on its full range of product offerings.</p><p class="complaint">IBM received help from the open-source

supplying a similar operating system to banks and governments.</p><p class="comment">IBM is talking about adapting Linux to the
existing customer base to which it was selling mainframe operating
systems before Unix was invented.  It's talking about adding
capabilities to Linux that do not exist in SCO's current product line.
SCO does not sell UnixWare to Mastercard and Visa for use in their
central credit card transaction processing computers.  SCO is not in
the same league as IBM, Sun, and HP, and never has been.  SCO's

Caldera participated in LinuxWorld long before IBM.  Caldera's CEO
Ransom Love gave a keynote address at LinuxWorld Expo in 2000 on what
it would take for Linux to be adopted across the entire landscape, and
on what the SCO acquisition meant to Caldera and the Linux world.  If

Linux; they understand the commoditization of software through the
parallel with the PC and the rise of commodity hardware.  SCO's previous
CEO (Ransom Love) knew about this.  If SCO's current CEO (Darl McBride)
didn't get it, he was blind.  (He certainly wasn't ignorant of it;

point to any datacenters built around their own products, which mostly
run things like fast food cash registers.  Corporate datacenters have
mainframes or rackmounted computer equipment in climate-controlled

do enterprise development, on any platform, without the help of a tiny

the enterprise techniques at issue.  If IBM can scale mainframe
technology down to create PC operating systems like OS/2, it is quite
capable of beefing up Linux without reference to AIX, especially if it
budgets a billion dollars annually and thousands of developers around
the world to do so.</p><p class="comment">Third, Caldera itself was focused on increasing

not limitation, IBM has used protected UNIX methods for others in
accelerating development of the 2.4.x kernel and 2.5.x Linux kernel

Linux development, the Linux 2.4.x kernel and 2.5.x kernel capacity to
perform high-end enterprise computing functions would be severely
limited.</p><p class="comment">IBM technology has out-scaled SCO technology for
many years.  (The same is true for Sun, HP, and others.)  The original
Unix development at AT&amp;T was done on Digital Equipment Corporation
minicomputers in the PDP and VAX line, which were significantly less
powerful than a modern laptop computer.  With the power of computer
hardware doubling every 18 months, computer companies must constantly
invest in new research and development to stay current.  The
scalability work to perform well on the new hardware that came out in
the late 1980s and early 1990s was not done by AT&amp;T or its
successors, but by other companies like Sun, IBM, HP, Sequent, SGI.
SCO is claiming to own work that others did to enhance a codebase it
inherited, and further is attempting to bar two of those others (IBM
and Sequent) from using their own work in other contexts.</p><p class="comment">Going through the letters, it seems fairly obvious
that SCO has read the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/14188/" target="_top">2.5 merge
candidate list</a> that the lead author of this commentary, Rob Landley,
prepared in October 2002.  This list eventually contained around 30
projects that were submitted for inclusion in the 2.5 Linux kernel before
the first &quot;Feature freeze&quot; in preparation for the release of the next
stable version (2.6.0).</p><p class="comment">It's interesting to note that technology IBM has
submitted to Linux has been repeatedly turned down.  IBM's Enterprise
Volume Management System was rejected, prompting IBM to <a href="http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0211.0/1562.html" target="_top">gracefully
withdraw it</a>, and design a new system built on top of the
winner (Sistina's LVM2, see the 2.5 merge candidate list for links).
Linux luminary Alan Cox (maintainer of the 2.2 kernel series and Red
Hat's kernel maintainer for many years) replied, &quot;Throwing away a big

&quot;(d) NUMA scheduler and other scheduler improvements,&quot;...
Several people contributed to the NUMA scheduler in Linux 2.5.  Much
of the basic work was done by <a href="http://home.arcor.de/efocht/sched/" target="_top">Erich Focht of NEC in Germany</a>.  An IBM developer offered a smaller

decide between the various approaches.  Sequent has produced NUMA
hardware since the mid 1980's.  SCO has never produced its own

company that produced that hardware.</p><p class="comment">&quot;(e) Linux PPC 32- and 64-bit support,&quot;...  Again, IBM
invented the Power PC hardware.  IBM manufactuers it.  SCO does not ship
products for it.  SCO is claiming credit away from IBM for supporting Linux on
hardware IBM invented.  This is completely ludicrous.</p><p class="comment">&quot;(f) AIX Journaling File System,&quot;...  Was
created by IBM, not by SCO or any of its predecessors.</p><p class="comment">A filesystem organizes the data on a computer disk.
(Examples of different filesystems would be PC formatted floppy
diskette vs a Macintosh formatted floppy diskette.)  JFS, which stands
for Journaling FileSystem, was independently developed by IBM, and is
not a technology they licensed from SCO.  IBM independently developed
multiple compatible versions of JFS for their different operating
system products, including separate (but compatible) versions for AIX
and OS/2.  The version of JFS <a href="http://www.kerneltrap.com/node.php?id=385" target="_top">merged into
Linux</a> was based on the OS/2 version, not the AIX version.</p><p class="comment">A journaling filesystem is a way of storing data
that requires less clean-up work to recover from a power failure,
hardware failure, or other type of system crash that doesn't shut down
the computer cleanly.  IBM's JFS is just one of many types of
journaling filesystem, several companies have donated their journaling
technology to Linux.  Jon &quot;Maddog&quot; Hall, president of Linux
International, 
<a href="http://www.linux-mag.com/2000-06/hall_01.html" target="_top">mentioned the issue
of journaling filesystems in a 2000 interview</a>, suggesting more versions of journaling technology were
being donated than Linux could actually use:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="comment">Let's choose journaling filesystems as an
example. There are four or five different companies that have general
filesystem technology that they'd like to donate. Well, gang, why
don't you all come together and amongst yourselves, make the decision
as to which one is going to go in? If it wasn't your technology, you
know, grin and bear it. Take the defeat gracefully. It doesn't make
sense to have five different journaled filesystems in Linux. So, it's
a little bit of the culture that they have to
understand.</p></blockquote></div><p class="comment">JFS is one of four different journaling
filesystems (Red Hat's ext3, Namesys's Reiserfs, SGI's XFS, and IBM's
JFS) currently merged into mainstream versions of Linux.  The most
popular journaling Linux filesystems are ext3 (on Red Hat systems and
derivatives) and Reiserfs (for SuSE systems, including UnitedLinux).
The main reason to use JFS is to read data off of existing
JFS-formatted hard drives without having to reinstall, I.E. to ease
IBM customer migration from OS/2 or AIX to Linux.</p><p class="comment">&quot;(g) enterprise volume management system to
other Linux components,&quot;...  SCO is so out of it it didn't notice that
IBM's EVMS was rejected by the Linux kernel developers, in favor of

How does SCO itself do volume management?  What is SCO's competing
product that IBM is alledged to have stolen technology from?</p><p class="comment">&quot;(h) clusters and cluster installation,&quot;...
According to the <a href="http://beowulf.gsfc.nasa.gov/" target="_top">Beowulf
Project at Goddard Space Flight Center</a>:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="comment">The Beowulf Project began at the Goddard Space Flight
Center (GSFC) in the summer of 1994 with the assembly of a 16 node
cluster developed for the Earth and space sciences project (ESS) by
Thomas Sterling and Donald Becker, formerly of USRA/CESDIS. The
project quickly spread to other NASA sites, other R&amp;D labs and to
universities around the world. The project's scope and the number of
Beowulf installations grew at a fantastic rate during the late
1990's. As of mid 2000, the project continues to grow and it scope has
expanded. The Beowulf community now influences almost every aspect of

standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force as <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1094.html" target="_top">RFC 1094</a> in 1987.
As usual, SCO is claiming credit for somebody else's technology.
Caldera did do some bug fixes on NFS years ago, but they went <a href="http://www.caldera.com/developers/community/contrib/linux.html" target="_top">directly
in to the Linux kernel</a>.</p><p class="comment">&quot;(i) threading,&quot;...  SCO didn't invent
threading.  Sun claims to have brought threading to Unix
in 1992 with the introduction of Solaris.  (See Sun's
<a href="http://wwws.sun.com/software/whitepapers/solaris9/multithread.pdf" target="_top">
history of threading</a>, starting on page 9 of that link.)  The
Posix specification standardizing threading for Unix systems was issued
in 1995 (long before IBM had anything to do with Linux).</p><p class="comment">But threading
existed long before Solaris brought it to Unix: 
<a href="http://pages.prodigy.net/michaln/history/os210/index.html" target="_top">
OS/2 1.0 supported multithreading when it was introduced in 1987</a>.
So SCO is claiming that IBM can't handle a technology
that IBM shipped the first PC implementation of 15 years ago.  Neither
AT&amp;T Unix nor SCO/Microsoft Xenix supported threading when OS/2
1.0 came out, yet SCO claims it as a trade secret.</p><p class="comment">Ignorance of what other people have done is not a good
basis for a trade secret claim.  (&quot;I didn't know you pioneered this decades
ago&quot; is particularly weak.)</p><p class="comment">In addition, we mentioned earlier that IBM's NGPT
approach to threading was <a href="http://www-124.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/pthreads/docs/announcement" target="_top">rejected</a>
in favor of Red Hat's NPTL.  IBM came up with a good design, but the
open-source community came up with a better one.  IBM simply is not in
the driver's seat here.</p><p class="comment">&quot;(j) general systems management functions,&quot;...
Does SCO perhaps mean something like the <a href="http://www.coas.org/" target="_top">Caldera Open Administration System</a>
which they released for Linux (open source) in 1998?  Or perhaps they
mean the Webmin and OpenWBEM projects, which they <a href="http://www.caldera.com/developers/community/contrib/" target="_top">also take
credit for</a>.</p><p class="comment">Aside from all that, can SCO possibly believe
ANY computer company, let alone the world's largest, couldn't manage

by the United States government.  Thus, SCO, Sequent, IBM and all
other UNIX vendors are subject to strict export control regulations
with respect to any UNIX-based customer distribution.  To this end,
Sequent agreed in §4.01 of the Software Agreement to restrictions

indirectly make available all or portions of the Software Product to
countries outside the United States that are subject to strict

Iran, Syria, North Korea and Libya.  IBM is ignoring and attempting to
circumvent the export control restrictions that apply to UNIX as it
accelerates development of Linux for enterprise use.</p><p class="complaint">146.  Thus, IBM has breached §4.01 of the
Sequent Software Agreement by, inter alia, making extensive, advanced
multiprocessor scaling functions of the Software Product, including
NUMA technology, RCU technology, SMP technology and other derivative

anyone in the world with a computer.  As it relates to Linux 2.4.x and

computers into multi-processor supercomputers that can be used for
encryption, scientific research and weapons research.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2863987"></a>FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION</h2></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2863995"></a>(Unfair Competition)</h3></div></div><p class="complaint">147.

nothing to do with IBM, and everything to do with the reason
Tarantella discontinued OpenServer development, was looking into

with IBM in the first place.  The ancient Unix technology it purchased
is obsolete rubbish, useless on modern systems, has no hold over BSD,
and Linux has been an independent line of development from its
inception.</p><p class="comment">Leaving Linux out of it for a moment: before
this year SCO/Caldera did not sell &quot;System V&quot;.  SCO/Tarantella also
did not sell &quot;System V&quot;, it sold UnixWare and OpenServer.  They are

of SCO's server division, does not mention System V, not even
once.<sup>[<a name="id2864381" href="#ftn.id2864381">19</a>]</sup> System V was worthless by
the end of the BSD lawsuit, which was settled shortly before Novell
rid itself of Unix.  Everybody who wanted System V licenses had
already purchased &quot;irrevocable, perpetual&quot; versions long before
Caldera got ahold of it.  The few old-time licensees who had not
bought out their royalty obligations were paying royalties to Novell,
not to SCO.</p><p class="comment">Neither UnixWare nor OpenServer were initiated
by then-owners of AT&amp;T's System V rights.  They were seperate
lines of development, initiated by normal Unix Licensees, and not tied
to AT&amp;T's System V rights in any special way.  Novell had not yet
purchased USL when it started UnixWare, and SCO and Microsoft were
normal Unix licensees (not owners) when Xenix was renamed to
OpenServer.  UnixWare and OpenServer were always minor versions of
Unix, the versions belonging to other vendors have always been more
important and more lucrative: Sun's Solaris, HP's HP-UX, and IBM's AIX
being three surviving profitable examples.  All of these companies
have purchased &quot;irrevocable, perpetual&quot; licenses to AT&amp;T's old
Unix codebase, and will never owe SCO another dime for it.</p><p class="comment">The proprietary Unix industry is still worth
billions of dollars annually, money made off of Solaris, HP-UX, AIX,
and other proprietary Unix variants.  SCO's lack of participation in
this industry is entirely SCO's own fault: its products are
inadequate, its marketing strategy is completely ineffective, its
ability to negotiate business deals is nonexistent, and its poor
financial health and history of declining revenue have discouraged
large corporate customers from partnering with a company that may not
be around in future to support its products.  This is why
SCO/Tarantella wanted to sell its Unix business.  Caldera was stupid
to shift focus from its Linux business to its Unix business, but it
has only itself to blame.</p><p class="comment">UnixWare is trailing edge technology,
approximately on a par with the Linux 2.2 kernel from 1999.
OpenServer is so obsolete SCO/Tarantella attempted to discontinue its
development in 1999, but it has an entrenched userbase of point of
sale systems whose owners don't care how obsolete the technology is,
and are so resistant to change they're willing to pay a premium to
avoid having to upgrade.  System V is a museum piece, an obsolete relic
primarily of interest to historians.</p><p class="comment">SCO's business strategy has been to milk its
installed base, surviving off a steadily declining revenue stream and
attempting to cut costs to achieve profitability.  They must have
known there was no future in that strategy when they set off down that
path, and it is dishonest of them to try to blame others for their own

version derived from System V is one of dozens of derived versions,
all extended far beyond the original 20 year old System V code.</p><p class="comment">SCO has no patents, they don't own the trademark,
copyright won't serve them and the only contract they have with the Linux
community is the General Public License, which SCO is the one violating.  So
they fall back on trade secrets, which aren't secret anymore after 30,000
different source licenses were issued over a period of 30 years, many of them
even explicitly licensed for educational purposes.  This is one area where
anecdotal evidence DOES help: a trade secret only has to be leaked once in
order to no longer be secret.  Eric is collecting these stories on his <a href="http://catb.org/~esr/nosecrets/" target="_top">no secrets page.</a> If you have a
story to contribute, contact Eric.</p><p class="comment">Even without the 30 years and 30,000 licensees, SCO's
trade secret claims are weak for other reasons.  The judge in the BSD
lawsuit <a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/bsdi/930303.ruling.txt" target="_top">refused
to issue a preliminary injunction</a> because he didn't see any
trade secrets at risk.  SCO/Caldera itself put Unix System III and
earlier up for download on its web page.  And of course SCO shipped
Linux 2.4.14 (and more recent versions as part of UnitedLinux), and profited
from doing so, apparently without performing any sort of due dilligence upon
what exactly it was shipping.  Now they claim it's a secret.</p><p class="comment">The real reason SCO is focusing on trade secrets is
that it gives them an excuse (however weak) to pretend to have evidence
without having to actually produce any in public.  This plays well
in the press, but is unlikely to help them in court.  The Open Source
community has an old saying, &quot;Shut up and show me the code&quot;.</p><p class="comment">SCO of course has not indicated any specific
trade screts it considers to have been misappropriated.  Presumably
SCO will be forced to reveal in court precisely what trade secrets it
thinks IBM misappropriated, and expert witnesses will be allowed to
research the matter and individualy prove that each one was already
widely known in the industry and academia.  Considering that SCO is
claiming ownership of RCU, which Sequent/IBM invented and owns a
patent on, this is unlikely to be too difficult.</p><p class="complaint">162.  SCO's Trade Secrets are embodied
within SCO's proprietary SCO OpenServer and its related shared
libraries and SCO's UnixWare and its related shared
libraries.</p><p class="complaint">163.  SCO and its predecessors in interest have
expended over one billion dollars to develop SCO's Trade
Secrets.</p><p class="comment">Depreciated according to Moore's Law.  Digital
Equipment Corporation spent more than a billion dollars developing the
VAX, which is no longer being sold.</p><p class="comment">Caldera purchased SCO's Unix business for $36
million.  This included the OpenServer product line developed by
SCO/Tarantella and Microsoft, the UnixWare product line developed by
Novell, and the ancient versions of Unix (System V and earlier)
developed by AT&amp;T.  However much this code initially cost to
develop, Caldera put System III and earlier up as a free download on
their website, and OpenServer was at the time a discontinued product
line for which the development of new features had been ruled out by
SCO/Tarantella, one which Caldera initially did not want to purchase
from SCO.  And Caldera's publicly stated interest in the acquisition
of SCO was to get a distribution channel through which to sell Caldera
OpenLinux.  Therefore, only a tiny fraction of the $36 million could
be attributed to System V.  In its last annual report, Caldera itself
put the value of all the Unix technology it acquired from SCO
(OpenServer, UnixWare, System V, System III, etc...) at around $1
million.</p><p class="comment">Depreciation aside, it's also interesting to
note that the $1 billion dollar figure keeps getting re-used.  SCO
thinks it suffered a billion dollars damages from copyrights, and a
billion dollars damages from trade secrets.  Except this is the same
billion dollars approached from two different directions; it didn't
get spent twice.  SCO has also repeatedly <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/story/0%2C%2Ct269-s2135391%2C00.html" target="_top">made and
withdrawn allegations about patents</a> in the trade press.
Presumably, patents would be a third re-use of the same billion dollar
figure, if Novell hadn't retained the Unix patents back when it sold
its Unix contracts to SCO and gave the Unix trademark to The Open
Group.</p><p class="complaint">164.  IBM, through improper means acquired and
misappropriated SCO's Trade Secrets for its own use and benefit,
for use in competition with SCO and in an effort to destroy
SCO.</p><p class="comment">SCO is destroying itself quite nicely without
any help from IBM.  The first profitable quarter SCO/Caldera
<span class="emphasis"><em>ever had</em></span> as a publicly traded company was due to
Microsoft paying them to support the suit against IBM.</p><p class="complaint">165.  At the time that IBM acquired access to
SCO's Trade Secrets, IBM knew that it had a duty to maintain the
secrecy of SCO's Trade Secrets or limit their use.</p><p class="comment">At which time?  Is it talking about the System V
licensing back in the 1980's or about the Monterey project?  Be
specific.  And what trade secrets does SCO claim IBM leaked?  At SCOForum
2003, SCO showed the audience A) a piece of code submitted by SGI and
quickly ripped out again because it was bad code and unnecessary (long
before SCOForum), B) a section of the Berkeley Packet Filter, from BSD.
That's the best they could do at their own annual developer conference.</p><p class="complaint">166.  SCO's Trade Secrets derive
independent economic value, are not generally known to third persons,
are not readily ascertainable by proper means by other persons who can
obtain economic value from their disclosure and use, and are subject
to reasonable efforts by SCO and its predecessors to maintain
secrecy.</p><p class="comment">SCO must not only exert reasonable efforts, it must
have a perfect record.  A trade secret that legitimately leaks even once is no
longer a secret.  If SCO or its authorized agents screwed up even once,
so that the recipient of the code was given it by someone who was authorized
to have it, but the recipient was not bound by a non-disclosure agreement,
then the secret is no longer a secret.</p><p class="complaint">167.  The acts and conduct of IBM in
misappropriating and encouraging, inducing and causing others to
commit material misappropriation of SCO's Trade Secrets are the
direct and proximate cause of a <span class="highlight">near-complete
devaluation and destruction of the market value of SCO OpenServer and SCO
UnixWare that would not have otherwise occurred but for the conduct of
IBM.</span></p><p class="comment">SCO is completely wrong that the devaluation
of OpenServer and UnixWare would not have occured without IBM.
Consolidation in the Unix business was already occuring when the Mark
Williams Company, makers of Coherent, went out of business in 1995.
The consolidation of System V, UnixWare, and OpenServer under one roof
is an example of what the industry refers to as <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/D/dinosaurs-mating.html" target="_top">&quot;dinosaurs
mating&quot;</a>, and that consolidation happened in 1995, long before
IBM's involvement with Linux.</p><p class="complaint">168.  Pursuant to Utah Code Ann. §13-24-4,

willful, malicious, and in reckless disregard of plaintiff's
rights, SCO is entitled to an award of exemplary damages against IBM
in an amount equal to two times the amount of damages, pursuant to
Utah Code Ann. §13-24-4(2).</p><p class="comment">On the evidence, IBM did not take any willful,
malicious, or reckless actions towards SCO.  IBM wasn't paying the
slightest bit of attention to SCO.  When SCO's stock was trading at
$1/share, IBM could have purchased the entire company for less money
than it cost to stage the annual <a href="http://www.forbes.com/1999/11/16/mu1.html" target="_top">Comdex expo in
1999</a>, another business enterprise that has been <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6461" target="_top">hit by hard
times</a>.  Is Comdex expected to sue IBM next, just because IBM
is still making money and they aren't?</p><p class="complaint">170.  Plaintiff is also entitled to an award of
attorneys' fees and costs in an amount to be proven at the time
of trial pursuant to Utah Code Ann.  §13-24-5.</p><p class="comment">And if IBM wins, it should get attorneys' fees from
SCO for this harassment.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2865360"></a>Prayer for Relief</h2></div></div><p class="complaint">WHEREFORE, having fully set forth its
complaint, plaintiff prays for relief from this Court as
follows:</p><p class="complaint">1.  For damages under the First Cause of Action
for breach of the IBM Software Agreement in an amount not less than $1
billion, together with additional damages through and after the time
of trial foreseeably and consequentially resulting from IBM's
breach, in an amount to be proven at the time of trial;</p><p class="comment">There's that magically multiplying billion
dollars again.  SCO bought a distribution channel for $36 million
which had some old Unix technology sticking to it, and after scraping
that off it's trying to cash it in for $1 billion like it was a
lottery ticket.</p><p class="comment">SCO/Caldera's gross revenue off of the purchased Unix
products, while consistently declining every year, has totalled more than
$36 million.  The fact their net revenue on it has been negative is their
own fault, in gross terms it paid for itself.  (Barely, and mostly
due to the fact they changed their mind about purchasing OpenServer.)</p><p class="comment">If SCO did get an award from IBM, would this bar it
from going and suing other Linux companies?  This does seem to be its new
business model, it's moved out of the technology industry and into the
spurious lawsuit industry.  If it gets an award from IBM (say, one dollar,
a pat on the head, and cab fare home), would it be barred from suing anybody
else over the same code?  Or could it keep on suing anyone and everyone
who uses Linux, a product that has clearly outcompeted SCO's own products
in the marketplace?</p><p class="complaint">2.  For a permanent injunction under the First
and Second Causes of Action requiring IBM to return or destroy all
source code and binary copies of the Software Products and/or
prohibiting IBM from further contributions of the protected Software
Products into open source;</p><p class="comment">IBM's AIX business makes more money than the whole of
SCO.  IBM is in the process of slowly migrating its own AIX customers to
Linux, as is most of the rest of the industry.  The fact SCO/Caldera has
gone in the opposite direction from the rest of the industry is due to
Caldera's stupidity.</p><p class="comment">Law works on precendent, and the clear precedent here is
the BSD case.  A settlement was made whereby any specific and significant code
snippets the plaintiff can prove to be in violation of its copyrights (if any)
were removed from future versions of the other project, then the two code bases
were cleanly separated and declared unencumbered.  The precedent here is
almost inescapable; the BSD case was about the System V code base, and the
plaintiff there was SCO's predecessors in interest AT&amp;T, USL, and
Novell.</p><p class="complaint">3.  For restitution under the First and Second
Causes of Action in an amount measured by the benefits conferred upon
IBM by its ongoing, improper use of the Software Products, including
the full amount IBM receives as a result of its ongoing sales of AIX,
including software, services and hardware;</p><p class="comment">If SCO/Caldera asks for IBM's AIX revenue, than IBM
should ask SCO/Caldera to give back every dime of Linux revenue it made
from the sale of versions of Linux that contain any IBM code.  (Either
SCO accepts the Gnu Public License under which it shipped Linux up through
and including version 2.4.14, or it forfeits all that Linux revenue to IBM
and the rest of the Linux development community.  IBM is, after all,
spending $1 billion a year on Linux, and Caldera profited from Linux as
its core business for many years.)</p><p class="complaint">4.  For damages under the Third Cause of Action
for breach of the Sequent Software Agreement in an amount not less
than $1 billion, together with additional damages through and after
the time of trial foreseeably and consequentially resulting from
IBM's breach, in an amount to be proven at the time of
trial;</p><p class="comment">There's that multiplying $1 billion again.  It
wants every dime AT&amp;T ever spent on Unix back in the 1980's paid
to it by IBM, and then it wants another equal payment from Sequent.
SCO is explicitly asking for more money in damages than it says was
spent on the entire history of Unix development.</p><p class="complaint">5.  For relief under the Fourth Cause of Action
in an amount not less than $1 billion, for unfair competition arising
from common law, and damages for violations thereof, together with
additional damages through and after the time of trial;</p><p class="comment">The magic multiplying billion resurfaces.  SCO seems
to believe that all competition is &quot;unfair&quot;, and that its rightful
place as king of the world was taken from it via a conspiracy, and
the company to blame is obviously the company that invented the IBM PC that
it's been selling Unix for all these years.</p><p class="complaint">6.  For relief under the Fifth Cause of Action
in an amount to be proven at trial for tortious interference, together
with additional damages through and after the time of trial;</p><p class="comment">Back to the claim &quot;IBM turned Papa John's against us&quot;.
Presumably, some executives from the named companies will be willing to
testify on IBM's behalf.</p><p class="complaint">7.  For relief under the Sixth Cause of Action
in an amount to be proven at trial for misappropriation of trade
secrets arising from Utah Code Ann.  §13-24-1 et seq., together
with additional damages through and after the time of trial;</p><p class="comment">The judge in the BSD trial didn't see any AT&amp;T
System V trade secrets present in the BSD code base, it's unlikely that 20
years later AT&amp;T System V trade secrets would be found in Linux,
especially after Caldera put System III up for download on its website
and sold Linux 2.4.18 with source code under the GPL.</p><p class="complaint">8.  For a permanent injunction under the Third
Cause of Action to prohibit IBM from further contributions of the
protected Software Products into open source;</p><p class="comment">This essentially repeats entry number 2.</p><p class="complaint">9.  For punitive damages under the Fourth and
Fifth Causes of Action for IBM's malicious and willful conduct,
in an amount to be proven at trial;</p><p class="comment">IBM took action to improve a product (Linux)
which was Caldera's core business.  SCO/Caldera alleges they took code
from a product about which SCO/Caldera's CEO Ransom Love had promised
<a href="http://www.itweek.co.uk/Analysis/1109965" target="_top">&quot;We won't make

</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="comment"> &quot;We have more than two million

Under those circumstances, how could IBM possibly have acted maliciously?
Confused by mixed signals, certainly, but not malicious intent.</p><p class="complaint">10.  For exemplary damages pursuant to Utah

Plaintiff's address:


355 South 520 West
Lindon, Utah 84042
</pre><p class="complaint">
</p><p class="comment">The complaint ends here.  The following text is editors' 
appendices.</p></div><div class="appendix" lang="en"><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="decline_and_fall"></a>A. The Decline and Fall of Caldera</h2><p class="framing">So, how did it come to this?  How did Caldera, a
senior Linux vendor whose core business was developing, selling, and
supporting a Linux distribution ever since its founding in 1994 (the
same year as leading Linux vendor Red Hat), turn into a near-bankrupt
proprietary Unix company whose main product is spurious lawsuits about
20-year old technology?</p><p class="framing">The change happened gradually.  When <a href="http://www.vnunet.com/Analysis/1109965" target="_top">Caldera purchased the
server division of SCO in 2000</a>, they were primarily buying a
reseller channel through which to sell their Linux products (Caldera's
core business at the time). <sup>[<a name="id2865926" href="#ftn.id2865926">20</a>]</sup>
SCO's Unix technology came along for the ride because that's what the
distribution channel was currently selling, and switching everything over
to Linux would take time.</p><p class="framing">
As Caldera's CEO Ransom Love explained in an
<a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/story/0%2C%2Ct269-s2093314%2C00.html" target="_top">August 17,
2001 interview</a> in response to the question, &quot;How heavily
will you rely on resellers?&quot;:

</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="framing">We have a large OEM team directed towards OEMs
and resellers, and we see the channel as critical to business adoption
of Linux. The reseller is the one who takes our products, who
understands them and who turns them into solutions for business
customers. We now need VARs more than ever, even though we make Linux
as easy to install and manage as we can.</p><p class="framing">For the business customer buying open source
software, I don't believe in the direct market, I believe in the
channel. Open source software can be overwhelming to these
customers.</p></blockquote></div><p class="framing">
</p><p class="framing">Right before the acquisition, Caldera released
OpenLinux 2.3, which their October 4, 1999 press release touted as the
<a href="http://www.caldera.com/company/press/19991004sales.html" target="_top">Fastest
Selling Linux Product in Caldera History</a>.  They were doing
just fine with Linux, and had no reason to switch focus away from
their core business as a Linux distributor.  So why did they?
</p><p class="framing">Caldera's switch from a Linux vendor to a Unix vendor occurred
because the distribution channel it had acquired from Tarantella was
more than it could control.  For Caldera the experience was like a
child wrestling with a fire hose.  The entrenched customer and
reseller relationships were many years old and completely inflexible,
and although they provided more gross revenue than the rest of Caldera
combined, they lost money in net terms because they cost so much to
operate.  Caldera tried to cut expenses to pare the channel down to
something they could manage, and that would actually be profitable,
but the gross revenue declined as the expenses declined, and
profitability remained tantalizingly out of reach.  Eventually, some
of them came to understood why Tarantella had been so happy to sell
their server business so cheaply.</p><p class="framing">Caldera's management changed as well, Caldera CEO and
co-founder Ransom Love brought in Darl McBride, who soon replaced Love as
CEO.  Renaming Caldera to SCO was one of McBride's first initiatives as CEO,
as explained in an
<a href="http://www.desktoplinux.com/articles/AT3224314245.html" target="_top">interview
DesktopLinux conducted with McBride at SCO/Caldera's 16th annual Forum</a>:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="framing">
DL: And when did the idea of changing the name back to SCO come up?
</p><p class="framing">
McBride: It came up early on. The very first week I was there...
</p><p class="framing">
                I had three books of press clippings over the past few months.
                Ninety-nine percent of the clippings related to Linux. Cool.
                Now, through the fifteen discussions, the identity crisis
                related to the fact that everyone talked about our core
                business. Ninety percent of our business comes from UNIX. And
                when you get out there, you have all these SCO re-sellers who
                don't attach to the corporate message.
</p><p class="framing">
                It was clear we have an identity crisis we've got to fix. And
                there are multiple ways we can fix it. We could pound on the
                SCO re-sellers until they &quot;get it.&quot; Obviously, that doesn't
                make sense, because they are generating good revenue. So you
                want to promote them, encourage them to go out selling, so
                that when Linux is ready for Prime Time, which it is really not
                right now, you are able to drop into that channel and get
                traction with the Linux products.
</p></blockquote></div><p class="framing">
</p><p class="framing">(In the same interview, Darl McBride also explains his
history with Linux and open-source software, and how Ransom Love recruited
him to come to Caldera.)</p><p class="framing">Along the way, Caldera forgot about repurposing the channel to sell
Linux.  Ignored, their Linux product atrophied to a small fraction of their
revenues.  Caught up in the ongoing cost-cutting, Linux development at Caldera
stagnated, and what was left was outsourced to another Linux
company (SuSE) through a partnership called UnitedLinux (of which
SCO/Caldera still owns 25%<sup>[<a name="id2866230" href="#ftn.id2866230">21</a>]</sup>).</p><p class="framing">In a wide-ranging <a href="http://techupdate.zdnet.com/techupdate/stories/main/0%2C14179%2C2877578%2C00.html" target="_top">August 15, 2002
interview with ZDNet</a>, McBride looks back on how SCO/Caldera had backed
away from Linux under his stewardship:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="framing">
ZDNET: Just a few years ago Caldera's Linux distributions were a major part of
its product lineup. These days Caldera's main push is Unix. What happened to
Linux?
</p><p class="framing">
McBride: The problem was, they were spending four marketing dollars to get one revenue dollar. No matter how much you raise on your IPO, you can't do that forever. I think acquiring SCO was a really smart thing. There was a view that the SCO business was going to go away, but actually it's been the opposite. The constricting of the economy has led to the effect that companies are not immediately swapping out core platform products, especially when they work as reliably as an SCO product does. We just signed a big licensing deal with McDonald's last week, BMW--these guys are coming back in droves right now, signing up to continue on with the platform. A year ago the strategy was &quot;Let's move all of our SCO customers onto Linux.&quot; We have a much different view of the world this year. We have an operating systems group here, and we have OpenServer, UnixWare, and UnitedLinux, and we're going to let customers choose whatever they want. Each OS is tuned for a different market--UnixWare is great for telcos, for example, and we think UnitedLinux is going to be better from a back-office point of view. At the point of sale with a lot of apps surrounding it, that's where SCO is doing well. What we want to do on top of that is add a set of open-source applications that wrap around that installed base, and try to make money on doing some of the higher-level services and apps as well. In a nutshell, that's where we're trying to go with the company.
</p></blockquote></div><p class="framing">
</p><p class="framing">
(The Ziff-Davis interview is primarily about SCO/Caldera's role in the
formation of UnitedLinux, and its plans for Linux going forward, but McBride
also opens with comments about his study of Caldera's ancient IP portfolio,
and how ignorant he was about Unix history when he took office.)
</p><p class="framing">Under McBride's leadership, Caldera gradually lost its
corporate identity entirely and <span class="emphasis"><em>became</em></span> the shriveled
husk of an unprofitable Unix business that Tarantella, Novell, and AT&amp;T
had sequentially disposed of.  You might think that the remains of
Caldera then had an enormous sour grapes reaction to Linux, decided that if it
couldn't profit from it anymore nobody else should either, and started suing
people.  But the reality was, they simply ran out of money and repeated
the last thing they'd done that produced a big pile of cash: suing a big
company over a long-obsolete product they'd purchased from the corpse of a
failed business.</p><p class="framing">Caldera had never been profitable since their
IPO.  For years, they had been coasting on the proceeds from the
settlement Microsoft paid them in their suit over Digital Research's
DR-DOS.  In 2000, shortly after Microsoft's antitrust conviction as an
abusive monopolist, Microsoft <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/600488.stm" target="_top">settled a
lawsuit</a> Caldera had filed against it, which claimed that
Microsoft put DR-DOS out of business by unfairly leveraging
Microsoft's monopoly.  After losing to the DOJ, Microsoft was willing
to give Caldera money to just go away and leave it alone.</p><p class="framing">The amount of the settlement was secret, but the answer (a little over
$150 million) is fairly easy to work out from the appropriate SEC filings.
<sup>[<a name="id2866396" href="#ftn.id2866396">22</a>]</sup>  (Interestingly, however Caldera did not get
this money.  Due to a corporate shell game detailed an an article in
The Register,
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/archive/9507.html" target="_top">the
Microsoft settlement was swallowed by Caldera's main shareholder</a>,
Ray Noorda's <a href="http://www.canopy.com" target="_top">Canopy group</a>.

<sup>[<a name="id2866435" href="#ftn.id2866435">23</a>]</sup>)</p><p class="framing">
Meanwhile, Caldera got $30
million of venture capital financing from Sun, SCO, Citrix, and Novell, and
went on to
<a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102542/0001035704-00-000192-index.html" target="_top">hold an IPO</a>
that netted them $65.1 million.  (This is an impressive amount of money,
but the venture capital and IPO combined were significantly less than the
legal settlement from Microsoft.)</p><p class="framing">This is the money they used to <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102542/000095013400006196/ex99-1.txt" target="_top">purchase SCO's server</a>
division later in
2000 (plus an $18 million loan from Canopy), and also the money that funded
their operations for the next three years.  But at the start of 2003 the money
ran out, and since they couldn't hold another IPO (certainly not with their
stock trading at around $1/share, which it was at the time), they looked
around for another big company with deep pockets to blame for the failure of
somebody else's antiquated technology, which they had since purchased.  They
forgot that last time, their lawsuit had an important element that this one
lacks: a case.</p><p class="framing">Of course SCO knows that since they go through cash like
toilet paper, a lump-sum payment merely buys them time.  What they're really
looking for (or what puppeteer Canopy is looking for) is
<a href="http://www.computerworld.com/softwaretopics/os/linux/story/0%2C10801%2C81709%2C00.html" target="_top">another buy-out</a>, just as Tarantella, Novell, and AT&amp;T
before them handed off the unprofitable System V hot potato, under the
&quot;bigger sucker&quot; theory.</p><p class="framing">SCO/Caldera's transformation from a Linux vendor to a Unix vendor
is very recent.  In February 2001, a <a href="http://linuxtoday.com/infrastructure/2001022600620NWCD" target="_top">letter outlining Caldera's official position</a>
from Nancy Pomeroy, Caldera's Director of Corporate Communications, was
written to reassure the Linux community:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="framing">Caldera Systems assures the Linux community that we are not pulling
out of Linux - more specifically that our OpenLinux workstation and
server products will continue. What will change is where we focus our
sales efforts. Caldera's focus has always been &quot;Linux for business.&quot;
With the pending acquisition of the Professional Services and Server
Software divisions of The Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) we will unify
UNIX and Linux for business. This business focus means selling our
products through the channel and OEMs. In fact, it's an important
reason why we view the SCO acquisition as strategic. SCO has a strong
presence in the channel.  When the acquisition is complete we will
have a combined Linux and UNIX channel of over 22,000 resellers.
</p><p class="framing">
At this time we are expending significant resources developing
OpenLinux workstation and server solutions that incorporate the 2.4
kernel. Given our business focus, the 2.4 kernel integrations in our
workstation and server solutions will continue to demonstrate our
commitment to stability, ease-of-use and manageability.
</p></blockquote></div><p class="framing">
</p><p class="framing">More succinctly, Caldera's CEO Ransom Love <a href="http://www.itweek.co.uk/Analysis/1109965" target="_top">promised after the SCO
acquisition</a>:

</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="framing">
Ransome Love, chief executive at Caldera, said: &quot;What the world needs now is a company that can give Linux a global infrastructure and a commitment to open source computing.&quot;
</p><p class="framing">
&quot;We won't make Unix proprietary,&quot; said Love. &quot;The future is an open internet
platform.&quot;
</p></blockquote></div><p class="framing">
</p><p class="framing">SCO/Caldera still has a <a href="http://www.caldera.com/developers/community/contrib/" target="_top">web page devoted to its contributions
to the open-source community</a>.  It's a fitting memorial to the company
they once were, and are no longer.</p></div><div class="appendix" lang="en"><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="marketsize"></a>B. Sizing the Unix Market</h2><p class="framing">If IBM is, as SCO alleges, engaged in a malign conspiracy to
destroy Unix, it is a remarkably ineffective one.  Other companies with
more competent management than SCO's are making quite a lot of money
selling Unix.  IBM itself does a land-office business in AIX, and 
it is no better than third in the market.</p><p class="framing">A recent article indicates that <a href="http://www.newsfactor.com/perl/story/21646.html" target="_top">HP made more
money from Linux last year as IBM did</a>, and goes on to say that
the Unix market (excluding Linux sales) is still worth over $4 billion
annually, and that Sun and HP are tied for first place with IBM coming
in third.  The fact that SCO's total gross annual Unix product revenue
was only $53 million in 2002 (<a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102542/000104746903003091/a2101798z10-k.htm" target="_top">see
page 35</a>) is not due to lack of opportunity in the
multi-billion dollar Unix market.</p><p class="framing">The fact that the Linux business is flourishing has yet to seriously
affect Sun, HP, or IBM's high end &#8220;enterprise&#8221; Unix business.
Most industry observers expect commodity Linux to climb into that market
eventually, but in a relatively gentle transition that most old-line Unix
companies seem to be handling gracefully.</p><p class="framing">SGI (Silicon Graphics, Inc.) provides an instructive example of
this transition.  It introduced <a href="http://www.sgi.com/products/legacy/intel.html" target="_top">x86-based
workstations</a> at the end of the 1990's, but instead of porting their
existing Unix product (Irix) to the Intel platform they chose to use Linux
instead.  SGI remains an ardent supporter of
<a href="http://oss.sgi.com" target="_top">open source</a> software development, and
<a href="http://www.sgi.com/developers/technology/linux/" target="_top">Linux</a> in
particular.</p><p class="framing">The intense competition SCO has experienced from Linux may more
accurately be put down to the fact that SCO is
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> in the &quot;enterprise&quot; Unix business, and never
has been.  It is a low-end PC Unix vendor, primarily selling cash
registers to fast food and retail outlets, which is a task for which a
modern Palm Pilot would be overkill.  Linux needed no help to flourish
on low-end PCs for most of a decade before IBM even noticed its
existence, and SCO had plenty of competition besides Linux in the
<a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/clone-unix-guide.txt" target="_top">low-end
PC Unix market back in 1994</a>. SCO/Caldera may finally have
figured out why SCO/Tarantella wanted to get out of the low-end PC
Unix business.  The market has commoditized and margins are razor-thin
there; neither of these things are IBM's fault.</p></div><div class="appendix" lang="en"><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="moores_law"></a>C. Moore's Law</h2><p class="framing">SCO doesn't bother to explain
<a href="http://www.intel.com/research/silicon/mooreslaw.htm" target="_top">Moore's
Law</a>, which is important for understanding both why there was
no special insight in SCO/Tarantella's business plan and why the System V 
technology SCO touts so highly is nearly valueless today.</p><p class="framing">Moore's Law was originally an observation about the economics
of integrated circuit manufacturing technology (<a href="ftp://download.intel.com/research/silicon/moorespaper.pdf" target="_top">published
on April 19, 1965</a>, some years before Gordon Moore
<sup>[<a name="id2866904" href="#ftn.id2866904">24</a>]</sup>
became a co-founder of Intel) but has since <a href="http://www.facsnet.org/tools/sci_tech/tech/fundaments/mooreslaw.php3" target="_top">been
generalized</a> into its modern form: that the amount of computing power
available at a given price point doubles every eighteen months.  (This
also means that a given amount of computing power &#8212; memory, processor
speed, disk drive space, etc &#8212; will generally be half as expensive a
year and half later.)</p><p class="framing">Moore's Law was almost 15 years old by the time of SCO's
founding; widely known and providing SCO with no unique insights.
Gordon Moore famously updated his law (to be more accurate based on
new information) for its tenth anniversary, at the IEEE International
Electron Devices meeting in 1975.  Here is a link to <a href="http://www.thocp.net/biographies/papers/moores_law.htm" target="_top">a 1979
commentary on Moore's Law</a> from Stanford University's Graduate
School of Business.</p><p class="framing">Moore's law is not limited to Intel chips, it applies
equally to competing processors like RISC systems or Motorola's 68k
processors.  Motorola's 68k processor line was the main competitor to
Intel's x86 line from the time of the IBM PC's introduction until Motorola,
IBM, and Apple's joint development of the Power PC processor line in the early
1990's.  Although IBM chose Intel's 16-bit x86 processors for the IBM
PC in 1981, most contemporary Unix vendors used the more powerful 32-bit 68k
processors for their workstations.  (Many other contemporary home
computer vendors also chose Motorola's 68k for their home computer
products: Apple used a 68k for the Macintosh, Commodore used a 68k for
the Amiga, Atari used a 68k for the ST...  Very few systems but IBM's
PC and its clones used Intel's x86 line at the start of the 1980's.)
The IBM PC took off not because of superior technology, but because of
IBM's brand name.</p><p class="framing">Even Intel didn't initially see IBM's PC as particularly interesting,
it was simply trying to win business away from Motorola's 68k.  In <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0%2C4149%2C1068065%2C00.aspara" target="_top">an
interview with PC magazine</a>, Intel's Gordon Moore (of Moore's
Law) explained:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="framing">That was a period of time when we were
competing very strongly with Motorola for design wins. They had a good
part out on the market, and we were concerned that they were going to
run away with a whole generation of designs, so we put together a very
aggressive marketing program, where we wanted to get 2,000 design
wins. I think it was in the '79-'80 time period, over something like a
year span, that time, and went aggressively out to pitch every design
we could.  Well one of those designs happened to be the IBM PC. In
fact the salesman that was calling on the account wasn't even told
what the project was...  eventually we found out it was the PC. But
even IBM expected only to sell a few hundred thousand of them over the
lifetime of the product. And while we thought it was a significant
design win, it was one of something like 3,000 that we had in that
time. And I certainly didn't realize that it was going to be the
future of Intel, even when the IBM PC got announced.
</p></blockquote></div><p class="framing">Moore's Law provided Intel with no guarantee of success in the
marketplace against other microprocessor competitors.  In the late
1970's, the company Zilog, founded by ex-Intel employees, out-competed
Intel in the 8-bit processor space before Intel moved upmarket to
16-bit and 32-bit processors.  (This is similar to the modern
relationship between Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), maker of
the x86 compatible &quot;Athlon&quot; processor line.)</p><p class="framing">Another interesting point is that Moore's Law can be used to calculate
depreciation.  The price of existing computer technology is cut in half
every 18 months, therefore ten year old technology has lost half its price
over six times, turning a million dollar hardware investment into about ten
thousand dollars.</p><p class="framing">The changes in hardware demand corresponding changes in software.
Networking once meant dial-up modems, now it means gigabit ethernet.  An
impressive graphics display was once 640 pixels wide and 480 pixels tall.  Now
even <a href="http://www6.tomshardware.com/mobile/20020306/a31p-06.html" target="_top">laptop
displays can have 1600 by 1200 resolution</a> (requiring 64 megabytes
of memory just for the video display, more than the entire system would have
had five years earlier).  Managing vastly different amounts of storage,
memory, and processing power demands different algorithms, leading to an
often overlooked result: <span class="emphasis"><em>Software also depreciates following Moore's
Law.</em></span></p><p class="framing">The effects of Moore's Law on software can be seen by the
fact that new versions of the same software come out every few years, and that
even spectacularly popular applications like Lotus 1-2-3 and WordPerfect can
stop selling a few years after their release unless successfully updated.
Version numbers like Word Perfect 8, Red Hat 9, and MacOS X (roman numeral 10)
are common because new versions must be released every year or two to remain competitive.

as worthless after only five years.

</p><p class="framing">SCO's claims regarding the Unix System V code from the mid 80's, a
decade older than the most recent versions of DOS, ignore twenty years of
Moore's Law depreciation.  But the declining price each time the Unix
technology changed hands (purchased by Novell, SCO/Tarantella, and SCO/Caldera
respectively) matches Moore's Law depreciation fairly well.</p><p class="framing">SCO/Tarantella agreed to sell its Unix business to SCO/Caldera
for a little over $53 million, although it eventually settled for
around $36 million.  <sup>[<a name="id2867252" href="#ftn.id2867252">25</a>]</sup>This is the
combined purchase price of not just the historical AT&amp;T codebase
(including the versions up through System III, which they
open-sourced), but also for the distribution/reseller channel, SCO's
OpenServer/Xenix product line, and Novell's UnixWare.</p><p class="framing">An additional three years of Moore's Law depreciation would be
two 18-month periods of 50% depreciation, yielding 25% of its original
value.  $53 million would become $13.25 million, and $36 million would
become $9 million.</p><p class="framing">But only a small fraction of the purchase price was attributed by
Caldera to the Unix technology.  Their <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102542/000104746903003091/a2101798z10-k.htm" target="_top">most
recent annual report</a> includes a breakdown of the Tarantella
acquisition on page 46.  They valued what they call &quot;Existing technology
(consisting primarily of UNIXWare and OpenServer)&quot; at $5.8 million, and the
&quot;Distribution/reseller channel&quot; at $26.7 million.<sup>[<a name="id2867353" href="#ftn.id2867353">26</a>]</sup>
This means that they were willing to pay 4.6 times as much for the distribution
channel as they were for the two Unix product lines the distribution channel
was selling.  (This is because at the time, they intended to repurpose the
channel to sell Caldera OpenLinux.)</p><p class="framing">
Of course what they were willing to pay for an asset, and how much they thought
it was actually worth once they had it, are different numbers.  On page 49
of that same annual report, SCO/Caldera notes that it wrote down half the
value of its reseller channel, and two thirds of the value of the acquired
Unix product lines.  It explains the reason behind the writedown on the
bottom of page 48:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="framing">
Subsequent to the acquisition of certain assets and operations from Tarantella
(see Note 3), the Company experienced significant unanticipated decreases in
actual and forecasted revenue of the acquired operations, a significant decline
in market valuations and general conditions, particularly in the information
technology sector, a weakening of partner relationships, the loss of certain
key executives, and other factors which indicated the recorded values of the
long-lived assets were impaired.
</p></blockquote></div><p class="framing">
This leaves the next table on page 49, which is still in use by SCO/Caldera's
<a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102542/000110465903012299/j2045_10q.htm" target="_top">2003 first quarter 10-Q filing</a>,
(on page 9, the table &quot;Amortized intangible assets&quot;)
<sup>[<a name="id2867421" href="#ftn.id2867421">27</a>]</sup>
In this table, Caldera values the technology they acquired from Tarantella at
a little under $1.7 million, with an estimated useful life of 5 years.  (This
is the period over which the asset will be fully depreciated for tax purposes.)
The $1.7 million figure includes the value of the SCO OpenServer and SCO
UnixWare product lines, as well as the historical AT&amp;T codebase (most of
which, specifically System III and earlier versions, they gave away for free by
putting it up on their website for free download).  Their own depreciation
estimates have already brought that $1.7 million down to around 1.1 million
since the purchase.</p><p class="framing">So either SCO/Caldera was lying to the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue Service, or at the time they
filed the lawsuit they believed their interest in all the Unix technology they
purchased from Tarantella to be worth just over $1 million.</p><p class="framing">
This low valuation may in part be due to the fact they do not have free and
clear ownership of this technology.  On page 34 of their most recent
<a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102542/000104746903003091/a2101798z10-k.htm" target="_top">annual
report</a> (filed at the start of 2003), they show a &quot;Royalty payable to
Novell, Inc.&quot; of just under $1.9 million in 2001, and another $1.4 million
in 2002.  More detail is available from the 10-k on page 42 (Restricted
Cash and Royalty Payable to Novell, Inc.) and page 44 (Royalty Costs).
</p><p class="framing">
But more to the point, the main target of the acquisition was the distribution
channel, not the Unix products (which were redundant, since Caldera already
had a competing Linux product).  In the same asset amortization table,
SCO/Caldera also assigns a dollar value of $11.6 million to the
distribution/reseller channel acquired from SCO/Tarantella;
almost seven times as much as the acquired technology.  Therefore, by Caldera's
own SEC filings, their purchase of SCO's server division was mostly about
acquiring a reseller network, and the Unix technology (including System V)
was a side issue worth (at most) a little under 1/7th of the purchase price.
(This is up from the 4.6 times as much they paid for the distribution network
vs the acquired technology: as time went on, the reseller network became
relatively more important to them.)</p><p class="framing">This matches numerous statements Caldera made at the time of the
SCO acquisition, that the reason for the acquisition was to acquire a reseller
channel through which to push their Linux products.  We talked about this in
the introduction to this rebuttal.</p><p class="framing">
SCO/Caldera's lifespan estimate for the acquired distribution/reseller
channel was 5 years.  This may have been optimistic, since one of the
more pronounced effects of their massive cost-cutting campaign, in addition
to gutting their research and development effort, has been to dismantle
the distribution/reseller channel they acquired.  They've laid off personell,
closed plants, and terminated business relationships.  Page 11 of SCO/Caldera's

is devoted to their &quot;restructuring plans&quot;, including &quot;reduction in facilities&quot;,
&quot;severance costs of affected employees&quot;, and the liquidation of their United
Kingdom subsidiary, &quot;SCO Group, Ltd.&quot;.</p><p class="framing">The relevance of Moore's Law for this case is threefold.  First,
it took no special insight to foresee that Intel chips would become
sufficiently powerful to support Unix.  Secondly, that the reason Intel's
x86 line came to dominate over competing processor manufacturers was due to
IBM's use of x86 in the IBM PC, which became the widely cloned industry
standard commodity hardware platform, and not simply due to Moore's Law as SCO
states.</p><p class="framing">Third, the market value of the ancient Unix sources had depreciated to
irrelevance at least a decade ago, which is why nobody outbid Caldera
to purchase it, and damages significantly in excess of Caldera's purchase
price for the technology (minus contined Moore's Law depreciation, 75% every
three years) are completely unsupported.  SCO/Caldera's own estimates from
the start of this year, including OpenServer and UnixWare, place the
technology's value at just over $1 million.  Moore's law indicates that a
computer technology purchased for $5.8 million should depreciate to a little
under 1.5 million in three years due to the natural progression of the
industry, without any help from IBM.  This is roughly consistent with the
observed behavior.</p></div><div class="appendix" lang="en"><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="itanium"></a>D. The Itanic Disaster</h2><p class="framing">SCO purports to believe that the collapse of its business

failure of the Monterey project, depriving SCO of a viable new proprietary Unix

allowing SCO to attract the high-end enterprise customers its own efforts had
failed to impress.  But insofar as SCO is a victim of anything but its own

It has failed spectacularly, garnering the nickname &quot;Itanic&quot;.  To understand
what went wrong, a little history is required for context:</p><p class="framing">The original IBM PC, which was announced on
<a href="http://www.bricklin.com/ibmpcannouncement1981.htm" target="_top">August 12, 1981</a>
used Intel's first 16-bit processor, the 8086, which could
only access one megabyte of Random Access computer Memory (&quot;RAM&quot;).
This is the processor Microsoft hired SCO to port Xenix to, and the main source
of the &quot;design challenges&quot; they talked about in paragraph 36.  (An early
successor of the 8086, the 80286, could access 16 megabytes but only through
the use of awkward and clumsy extensions which were of no use to most
programs.)</p><p class="framing">The original mid-1981 IBM PC came installed with anywhere from 16k
to 64k of RAM, depending on how much the purchaser wanted to pay.
Moore's Law says that memory capacity at a given price point doubles
every 18 months, so a simple mathematical formula can express
approximately how much memory a high-end mainstream PC could be
expected to have in any given year.

retail sale.  After being sold the systems remain in use for a number of
years, as part of the &quot;installed base&quot; for which new software could
still be sold.  Three years past the low-end is a good first estimate
for the trailing edge of the installed base<sup>[<a name="id2867854" href="#ftn.id2867854">29</a>]</sup>.
By using Moore's Law, Intel could easily and accurately predict that by the
early 1990s the 1 megabyte of memory their 16-bit processors could provide to
16-bit DOS programs would fall off the bottom of the capability range that
mainstream users were demanding in order to run then-modern software.
</p><p class="framing">To prepare for this, Intel introduced its first 32-bit
processor, the Intel 80386 (abbreviated &quot;386&quot;), on <a href="http://www.intel.com/pressroom/kits/quickreffam.htm#i486" target="_top">October
17, 1985</a>.  The 386 was plagued with initial technical
difficulties and was not produced in large quantities the first year.
32-bit processors did not become the standard PC processor (with more
than 50% of installed base using 32-bit processors instead of 16-bit)
until the early 90's.</p><p class="framing">Intel knew that the switchover wouldn't be instantaneous, and
prepared for a gradual transition by designing their new 32-bit
processors with the ability to emulate the earlier 16-bit processors,
in order to run the existing 16-bit software.  In fact, the new 32-bit
processors were faster at running the old 16-bit programs than the old
16-bit processors had been, so mainstream users had an incentive to buy
a new 386-based system to run their existing 16-bit software when they
upgraded their systems.  Gradually, as the 386 and its successors became
widely deployed, 32-bit applications (capable of using the extra memory but
also requiring the newer processor type to run at all) trickled into the
market.</p><p class="framing">The point of no return in the switch to 32-bit software was the release
of Windows 95 on
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020128085543/http://saturn.geog.umb.edu/CLASSES/NT/WEEK1/" target="_top">August 24, 1995</a>.
Windows 95 was the first operating system from Microsoft which required a
32-bit processor to run the OS itself.  This came a full decade after the
release of the 386.</p><p class="framing">The 386 was a good processor, which (with its successors) did
eventually take over the PC market.  The initial 386 could access 4
gigabytes of RAM.  (Some of the 386's successors in the &quot;Pentium&quot; line
can access up to 64 gigabytes (2^36 bytes) of memory through another
set of awkward and clumsy extensions like those of the 286, but again this
doesn't help most programs.)  4 gigabytes is still not quite a
mainstream limiting factor today, but according to the table above it
will become one for the high end of mainstream systems somewhere
around 2005.  Just as the move from 16 to 32-bit computing had been
driven by the need to let programs access more than one megabyte of
memory, the need for Intel's new &quot;64&quot; bit processor was rooted in the
looming 4 gigabyte barrier.</p><p class="framing">To prepare for this, Intel teamed up with Hewlett Packard (HP) during
the 1990s to design a new 64-bit proccessor.  This new processor was
originally code-named &quot;Merced&quot;, and rechristened &quot;Itanium&quot; by Intel's
marketing department around the time Intel started actually selling them.
64-bit processors like Itanium can access so much memory
(2<sup>64</sup> is 18,446,744,073,709,551,616, or 18 exabytes,
or 18 billion gigabytes) that Moore's Law may hit physical limits (such as the
inability to make circuitry smaller than the atoms it's constructed from)
before we have to switch again.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2867992"></a>Why Itanium Failed</h2></div></div><p class="framing">When Intel teamed up with other companies to create the 64-bit processor
design which eventually became Itanium, they bit off more than they could chew.
Instead of choosing to do a simple 64-bit extension of the x86 platform, they
chose to do a whole new design based on the unproven &quot;VLIW&quot; (Very Long
Instruction Word) technique
<a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/vliw/" target="_top">pioneered by IBM in 1986</a>.
VLIW can be briefly described as a successor to RISC (Reduced Instruction
Set Computing), which is a way of simplifying processor designs which IBM had
<a href="http://www.aallison.com/history.htm" target="_top">previously invented</a>.
Intel's new project, originally code-named &quot;Merced&quot;,  was based on a very different
design approach from traditional 16-bit and 32-bit x86 designs, and Intel
and its partners had a lot of trouble making it work.</p><p class="framing">Even though Intel and HP
<a href="http://www.microprocessor.sscc.ru/Merced/" target="_top">announced their
joint research and development project in June 1994</a>, the release
of Intel's new 64-bit processor didn't occur for more than five years after
that.  The release of new design was repeatedly delayed (see

<a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1001-222940.html?tag=rn" target="_top">HP and
SGI revived their own RISC processor designs</a> rather than wait for
the joint effort with Intel to bear fruit.</p><p class="framing">
On July 13, 1999, Intel announced that their 64-bit processor design (then
still called Merced)
<a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1001-228392.html" target="_top">had
been completed and submitted to manufacturing</a>, which normally means that
actual chips would soon be produced and the processor could be expected to
appear in finished computers about one year later.  But more than a year later,
the processor remained off the market.
</p><p class="framing">
On October 4, 1999,
<a href="http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/sp100499.htm" target="_top">Intel's
marketing department renamed Merced to &quot;Itanium&quot;</a>.  More importantly,
they announced a change of direction for the chip, abandoning the desktop in
favor of the dot-com server market.  This was immediately percieved as a
horrendously stupid move (even before the dot-com crash of 2000).  Without the
economies of scale from tens of millions of desktop machines, the Itanium could
never become as cheap as the existing 32-bit x86 processors, and would lose
out on the all-important price to performance ratio that drives purchasing
decisions in a vicious circle.  Without millions of desktop users and the
developers who service them, Itanium would never sprout the quantity and
variety of supporting software the x86 market has.  And beyond that, it would
leave a market vacuum for somebody else to produce a 64-bit upgrade for the x86
for the desktop when the 4 gigabyte barrier struck home.  That someone else
would define the new processor standard, and reap all the advantages.</p><p class="framing">
Without the desktop, Itanium could not be the next generation of x86.  It
became just one more bespoke 64-bit processor to run customized software
behind locked doors in server rooms, competing in a very small market niche against established 64-bit
versions of Alpha, PowerPC, UltraSparc, HP-PA...</p><p class="framing">Before the month was out, the nickname &quot;Itanic&quot; was coined.  Its first

the Merced Itanium is late every six months or so, only to be re-assured that
it will arrive in the second half of next year or this year.&#8221;</p><p class="framing">The reason for the repeated delays, and Intel's retreat from the 64-bit
desktop market, was that Itanium's performance was unacceptably slow.  Due to
its complexity, the part could not be manufactured at clock speeds greater than
800 mhz, at a time when 32-bit Athlon and Pentium processors were available at
gigahertz (1000 mhz) or faster speeds.  Worse, even at the same clock speed
Itanium's performance was only around half that of a comparatively clocked
32-bit processor.  The article

2 to Launch to Lukewarm Reception</a> points out, &quot;... enthusiasm over
Itanium's once touted backward capability to run 32-bit Windows applications
was largely doused last year after tests revealed that the chip could only
process such programs about as fast as a 4-year old Pentium II chip.&quot;
</p><p class="framing">
The earlier seamless transition from 16-bit to 32-bit processors in the x86
line had occurred because the 386 ran 16-bit code faster than the original
16-bit processors could, and was fairly cheap (and became cheaper as compatible
successors like the 486 and Pentium quickly followed it).  In colloquial terms,
upgrading to a 32-bit system was a no-brainer, and the bang for the buck was
excellent.  But although the Itanium could run 32-bit x86 software, it was both
significantly slower and significantly more expensive (costing thousands of
dollars for the processor alone, and over time that
<a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/Article109753.htm" target="_top">price went up</a> while Moore's Law brought competing prices down).  Intel was forced by competitor AMD (which
made x86 compatible &quot;Athlon&quot; processors) to keep improving its 32-bit Pentium
line, and the performance and cost effectiveness of the new Athlon and Pentium
4 processors left Itanium in the dust.</p><p class="framing">Intel struggled ahead, but by this point it was hard
work merely to establish even a niche market for Itanium, and once vendors had
real chips to test they quickly found numerous flaws.  The article

commercially in May 2001, and quotes Dell senior vice president Joe Marengi as

fall 2001.

</p><p class="framing">Trying to stave off disaster, Intel <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1001-243319.html" target="_top">promised for years</a>
that a second generation of the Itanium design (code-named McKinley) would
raise the Itanic.  This new version was
<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0%2Caid%2C96484%2C00.asp" target="_top">launched
as &quot;Itanium 2&quot;</a> in mid 2002, but as that above article states:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="framing">
While Intel has dominated the market for 32-bit processors, it failed to make much headway against 64-bit chips from Sun Microsystems and IBM with the first iteration of its Itanium line.

</p></blockquote></div><p class="framing">Despite the promises, Itanium 2 couldn't solve
the fundamental design problems of Itanium.  <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=7983" target="_top">Only 3,500 Intel

estimated</a> that Itanium sales would still be lagging behind
other 64-bit chips (such as IBM's PowerPC, Sun's UltraSparc, and HP's
Alpha and HP-PA lines) at least through 2007.  As recently as December
2002, stories about <a href="http://www.vnunet.com/News/1136759" target="_top">Itanium 2 performance lagging

but Itanium was by then such a disaster it was no longer particularly
newsworthy.  A <a href="http://www.vnunet.com/Analysis/1141320" target="_top">recent technical
editorial</a> summarized the situation, &quot;After some 10 years of
development, Intel and HP have made a costly chip that seems suited to
a few niches.&quot;</p><p class="framing">However, the need for more than 4 gigabytes of memory continued to
press, leaving a market vacuum for a simple 64-bit extension to the 32-bit
x86 design.  The new processor should run existing 32-bit software quickly and
cheaply, but allow new programs that make use of its extensions to access more
memory.  Since Intel refused to
publicly admit defeat with Itanium, its main competitor AMD came out with its
own 64-bit design called <a href="http://www.amd.com/us-en/Processors/ProductInformation/0%2C%2C30_118_8825%2C00.html" target="_top">&quot;Opteron&quot;</a>

to do to inherit the installed base of software.  Unlike Intel, AMD is

<span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> reason for the failure of project Monterey.
In the 1990's, the proprietary Unix market had once again fragmented
itself into near-irrelevance with numerous incompatible versions, and
seeking to salvage something from the mess by bringing together
several vendors around a common standard was the traditional response.
(See the response to paragraph 48 for some earlier examples of this
traditional response, such as OSF/1). This unification is the reason
IBM gave for <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19991019002305/http://www.linuxworld.com/linuxworld/lw-1998-10/lw-10-monterey.html" target="_top">launching
Project Monterey</a> as a multi-vendor effort including other
vendors such as SCO.  The article states:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="framing">
The ultimate goal of the companies is to give software vendors a single
platform to port to for 32- and 64-bit Unix systems on Intel and IBM Power
microprocessors, they said.
</p></blockquote></div><p class="framing">Unfortunately, they wanted to create a single
common Unix platform that did not include the dominant Unix vendors,
Sun Microsystems and Hewlett Packard.  Trying to create a cross-vendor
standard Unix platform in 1998 without including Sun and HP was a lot
like trying to create a multi-vendor standard Linux platform without
including dominant players Red Hat and Debian, as SCO tried to do by
joining UnitedLinux a few years later.  Monterey predictably collapsed
back into the next version of IBM's AIX, just as UnitedLinux is
quickly becoming perceived as merely the next version of SuSE's Linux
distribution.  (Isn't it interesting the way SCO just keeps repeating
the same mistakes?)</p><p class="framing">Predictably, Monterey was by no means the only
&quot;Unix on Itanium&quot; effort.  For a while Sun Microsystems planned to
port its Solaris to Itanium, and <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1001-236954.html" target="_top">lined up a number of
large vendors behind it</a> (including Fujitsu, Siemens, and NCR).
IBM <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1001-229834.html" target="_top">tried to
compensate</a> by recruiting other big companies like Samsung and
Computer Associates to support Monterey.  For a while, other companies
(including SGI and Compaq) toyed with the idea of porting their own
in-house Unix variants to Itanium, before deciding there was
insufficient market justification.  By the time Monterey ground to a
halt, Sun's Solaris on Intel project project succumbed to
inter-company rivalry between Intel and Sun's own &quot;Sparc&quot; processor
division, and the general realization that Itanium wasn't ready for
prime time and they were just throwing good money after bad.
</p><p class="framing">Despite its spectacular failure to master 64-bit
computing, Intel remained the industry's leading 32-bit processor
vendor, and ignoring its efforts was uncomfortable for many corporate
decision makers.  Many of these companies decided the cheapest way to
hedge their bets against a sudden turnaround in Intel's 64-bit
fortunes was to support Linux on Itanium.  Hobbyists maintain Linux
support for a number of unusual types of hardware, including obsolete
<a href="http://linux-vax.sf.net" target="_top">Vax minicomputers</a>, or a
number of long-discontinued minicomputers like <a href="http://www.linux-m68k.org" target="_top">Amiga, Atari, and early
Macintosh</a> machines.  No matter how poorly Itanium did in the
market, to the Linux crowd it was just one more oddball niche platform
to support, no big deal.  More than that, the Linux port to Itanium
was ready by the time the prototype Itanium hardware was available,
but <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/hardware/0%2C39020351%2C2080311%2C00.htm" target="_top">the
proprietary operating systems were not</a>, and were publicly
happy that Intel's repeated hardware delays gave them more time to
work.</p><p class="framing">As the big players squabbled, Linux naturally and steadily
gained ground in the hearts and minds of corporate users looking for a working
64-bit platform.  If Intel's billions churned out a third or fourth revision of
Itanium that miraculously became relevant, Linux would support that hardware.
Meanwhile, Linux versions of 64-bit software could be run on any of the other
64-bit processors, to actually be deployed and in production while the
Itanium drama played itself out.</p><p class="framing">A working version of Linux for the Itanium was
already available before IBM cancelled project Monterey, and (due to
repeated delays) before Intel even commercially shipped the first
Itanium systems.  IBM and SCO were quite aware of this project at the
time.  SCO/Tarantella's CEO even gave <a href="http://www.vnunet.com/News/88805" target="_top">an amusing interview</a>
dismissing the Linux porting project, codenamed &quot;Trillian&quot;, as
irrelevant.  They were more worried about the proprietary Unix market
leaders, Sun and HP.</p></div></div><div class="footnotes"><br><hr width="100" align="left"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a name="ftn.id2791894" href="#id2791894">1</a>] </sup>Unix source code has been regularly

so he could port Linux to that hardware platform, but Linus had

received a system based on the 64-bit Alpha processor from Jon &quot;Maddog&quot; Hall of

Power PC hardware.</p><p>
All three of these events predated IBM's Linux kernel development efforts
by a number of years.  The Power PC was donated hardware (which was ignored).
The <a href="http://www-3.ibm.com/software/integration/support/supportpacs/individual/maci.html" target="_top">MQSeries client</a>
was not a product, but a client for a product.  (It was basically a building
block that could be used to develop an application; a piece of middleware
infrastructure to allow Linux clients to talk to other (non-Linux) systems

complete runnable Linux application offered by IBM, actively publicized as such,

the developers have nothing to go on but a description of the desired result,
a descripion which a lawyer has confirmed is not anybody's proprietary
property.  The term was probably invented by Compaq, which cloned IBM's BIOS
in the early 1980's to produce the first 100% compatable IBM PC clone.  A
clean room clone using virgin programmers (often hired straight out of college
or even high school to make sure they've never seen anything proprietary) is
something you do if you expect to get sued anyway, and want a paper trail to
prove your case in court.  It's faster and cheaper to just use experienced
programmers.

Novell was mostly a stock swap and profit sharing plan, so it's
difficult to pin a precise dollar value on it.  Novell's <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/758004/0000950149-96-000048.txt" target="_top">1996
annual report</a> sums up the transaction as follows:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>On December 6, 1995, Novell
completed the sale of its UnixWare product line to the Santa Cruz
Operation, Inc. (SCO). The Company expects to report a gain on this
transaction in the first quarter of fiscal 1996. Under the agreement,
Novell received approximately 6.1 million shares of SCO common stock,
resulting in an ownership position of approximately 17% of the
outstanding SCO common stock. The agreement also calls for Novell to
receive a revenue stream from SCO based on revenue performance of the
purchased UnixWare product line.  This revenue stream is not to exceed
$84 million net present value, and will end by the year 2002. In
addition, Novell will continue to receive revenue from existing
licenses for older versions of UNIX System source code.
</p></blockquote></div><p>Novell later put the cash value of the sale of
the Unix technology at $19 million, plus ongoing revenue from Unix
royalties (royalties which SCO/Caldera continues to pay to Novell).
These royalties were lumped together with &quot;Service, training,
consulting, and other&quot;.  The relevant description from page 11 of
Novell's <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/758004/0000950149-99-000088.txt" target="_top">1999
annual report</a> is:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Service, training, consulting, and
other includes revenue from customer service, training products and
courses, consulting for network solutions, UNIX royalties, and
other. These revenues were $166 million in fiscal 1998 compared to
$161 million in fiscal 1997, and $230 million in fiscal 1996. The
increase from fiscal 1997 to 1998 was due to the growth of service
revenue more than offsetting declines in UNIX royalties and other. The
decline from fiscal 1996 to 1997 is mainly the result of declining
sales of UNIX licenses as well as a one-time $19 million paid-up
royalty recognized on the sale of UNIX technology to SCO in fiscal
1996. Service, training, consulting, and other revenues were 15% of
revenue in fiscal 1998 compared to 16% of revenue in fiscal 1997, and
16% in fiscal 1996.</p></blockquote></div><p>The 72.4 million estimate quoted earlier is as good an estimate
as any we've found.  Novell wanted to wash its hands of Unix, and
wasn't particularly picky about how it did it.  The true figure is
almost certainly less than $100 million.  </p></div><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a name="ftn.id2864034" href="#id2864034">18</a>] </sup>Pull out your calculator: if you start with a billion

According to the article, the shell game apparently went something like this:
Caldera was split into three companies: Caldera Systems (a Linux business run
by Ransom Love), and an embedded systems company quickly renamed Lineo, were
both spun off from the original &quot;Caldera Inc.&quot;, leaving it an empty shell
with no employees, run by Bryan Sparks (also CEO of Lineo).  Caldera Inc.
received the Microsoft suit settlement money on behalf of Canopy, then faded
away.  Caldera Systems went on to have an IPO in order to fund its operations
(presumably deluding some investors into believing <span class="emphasis"><em>it</em></span> had
received the Microsoft money, and thus was in much better financial shape than
it really was.)  Shortly thereafter it switched corporate identity again to
&quot;Caldera International&quot;.  (And you wonder why it
forgot it had been a Linux company...)</p><p>
Canopy sold Lineo to Motorola in 2002.  Bryan Sparks went on to run Device
Logics, another Canopy company based on DR-DOS, a technology once owned by
Caldera, then Lineo, but never relinquished by Canopy.  Another Caldera
technology taken away from Caldera and used to start another Canopy company
was Caldera Volution manager, used to form Canopy's holding
<a href="http://www.volutiontech.com/products/volutionmanager.html" target="_top">Volution</a>.
(If SCO does come up with any major cash windfall, the authors of this
commentary would not be at all surprised to see Canopy find some way to absorb it
again.)</p><p>
At the time of the lawsuit's filing, Ray Noorda owned <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102542/000091205702033041/a2087863z8-k.txt" target="_top">47.7 percent of SCO/Caldera's's stock</a> through the Canopy Group, a division of
the Noorda Family Trust which Ray Noorda <a href="http://www.nwfusion.com/anniversary/legends/legends.html" target="_top">still personally oversaw as recently
as 2001</a>.  Although Canopy has reduced its ownership position slightly
since the lawsuit (taking advantage of the increased stock price to cash
out), it still owns more than 40% of Caldera's shares.  According to page 66 of
<a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102542/000104746903003091/a2101798z10-k.htm" target="_top">SCO/Caldera's most recent annual report</a>,
SCO's chairman of the board is the president and CEO of Canopy (meaning he
works for Ray Noorda the way Darl McBride works for him).  SCO/Caldera leases
its office space from Canopy.  On page 67 we learn that SCO's largest creditor
is the Canopy Group.</p><p>Presumably, Canopy could stop the lawsuit with a phone

10Q from Tarantella</a> (Note 7 beginning page 14), Caldera paid
SCO a total of $23 million in cash (the oft-quoted figure of $7
million in Q1 2001 was just the first installment), plus stock
totalling 28% of the ownership of Caldera, and an $8 million
prommisory note to be paid in installments.  Tarantella recorded
$53,267,000 as the sale price of server and professional services
groups, but in reality they didn't get that much.  Caldera's financial
position rapidly deteriorated, their stock price collapsed, and
Caldera announced a 1 for 4 reverse stock split (a desperation move to
avoid being de-listed by their stock exchange).  This convinced
Tarantella it would be a good idea to close out their debt and equity
positions with Caldera as quickly as possible, and get what they could
out of it.  So in the second quarter of 2001, Tarantella allowed
Caldera to cash in the $8 million promissory note for a single
up-front cash payment of $5 million, and convinced Caldera to buy back
$555 thousand worth of their stock.  In the third quarter, Tarantella
sold $4,360,938 of Caldera stock on the open market, and Caldera
bought back the remaining $3,059,250 worth.  By September 30, 2002,
Tarantella had unloaded all its Caldera stock.  Add in another $445k
of miscelaneous payments from Caldera to Tarantella, and the total
payment Tarantella received for its Unix division was
(445+555+5000+4361+3059=13,420 thousand, plus the original $23 million

saying &quot;we paid
more than we can justify on paper, and get to depreciate this imaginary
